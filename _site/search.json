    "text": "2.1 Evaluating the impact of selectivity assumptions\non stock recruitment relationships (SRR)\nTo examine the assumptions about fishery selectivity variability we ran alternative model configurations where selectivity variability was contrasted. In one configuration it was constrained such that the fishing mortality was considered completely separable with respect to age and one where there was limited constraint on the selectivity. This later model is similar in nature to traditional VPA models where the catch at age is assumed known precisely. The resulting selectivity patterns are shown in Figure 1. Results showed that very little difference between a freely specified selectivity model (Figure 2) Results comparing the constrained selectivity differed substantially from last year’s configuration (Figure 3).\nThe large differences due to assuming separability also impacts the estimates of the stock recruitment relationship (Figure 4). This figure also dipicts the different magnitude of the recent recruitment and an increased uncertainty. In particular, the 2018 year class is estimated to be much larger in the separable model.\nAnother form of evaluating the selectivity estimates was to simply apply each of the annual selectivity estimates (or partial Fs) from the past 20 years. We note that the base result used the mean selectivity over the recent 2 years; specifically, the mean selectivity for 2021 and 2022 for the 2023 terminal year assessment.\nResults show that …xxx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Selectivity-at-age patterns for three models: last-year’s, separable, and VPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Model results comparing last year’s selected model with one where the selectivity is more highly variable over time (VPA).

Extending the time series back to 1964 resulted in a different shaped curve with higher steepness (Figure 5). This was due to the inclusion of age-1 recruits from the early years.

We confirm that in past assessments, for the period which the SRR curve was applied, the bias correction term was included. Specifically,\n\\[ \\hat{R}_t = f(B_{t-1}) e^{\\epsilon_t-0.5 \\sigma_R^2} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_R^2)\\). Here the production function (which generates age-1 recruitment) is a function of spawning biomass in the previous year (\\(f(B_{t-1})\\)). Since this function “generates” age-1 recruitment from a lognormal distribution, the basis for this must be scaled accordingly. Therefore the assessment model numbers-at-age one (\\(\\dot{R_t}=N_{1,t}\\)), must account for the bias based on the SRR. This leads to the recruitment component of the negative log-likelihood as\n\\[ -ln(L_{rec}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\chi_t + \\frac{\\sigma^2_R}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2_R} + ln(\\sigma_R) \\right] \\]\nwhere \\(\\chi_t = \\log(\\dot{R}_t) - \\log(\\hat{R}_t)\\).

    "text": "2.8 Simulation testing the stock recruitment estimation\nA simple simulation framework was set up to show how patterns of the Ricker SRR can be influenced by the available “points” used in the estimation. We start with the estimates of spawning biomass and recruits from the 2023 accepted model. As in the assessment, we selected the period from 1978-2022 and fit a Ricker SRR. We then replicated the estimation using random error about both the estimate of recruitment and spawning biomass. These “data” were then sampled with replacement. The\n100 sets of data and resulting curves showed that the slope at the origin tends to be higher for these cases (are shown in (Figure 19). Note that these curves differ from the actual assessment since the fitting is done separately (we used the linear regression log recruits-per-spawning biomass vs spawning biomass). The point of this exercise is to show that extrapolating the fitted curves outside of the range of data (i.e., at smaller spawning stock sizes) can lead to very different and positively biased productivity estimates. The slope at the origin is a key parameter in the Ricker SRR and governs productivity estimates and consequently, \\(F_{MSY}\\) estimates. This suggests that applying the SRR estimates for management purposes (in Tier 1) may be inappropriate given this apparent potential for bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Results from simulation-estimation scenarios from the type of data available for EBS pollock, 1978-2022",
