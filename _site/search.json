    "text": "The work presented below was based on the same data sets used in the 2023 assessment. The model was updated so that it could handle a number of requests from the SSC. We enhanced the capability of the code to deal with some alternative hypotheses of factors that affect the stock recruitment relationship (SRR). We stepped through a number of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the stock-recruitment relationship (SRR) and the steepness of the SRR. We also evaluated the impact of including the natural mortality-at-age estimates from CEATTLE model.\n\n\n\nSome research has indicated that the value of \\(\\sigma_R\\) can be reasonably well estimated in both traditional stock assessment models and in state-space versions. Based on our analysis which shows that estimates appear reasonable, we caution about the application for management settings. This is because for EBS pollock, the SRR is heavily influenced by data to the right of \\(B_{MSY}\\) instead of nearer the origin (where measures of “steepness” might most reliably be estimated). We show that the SRR is thus linked to the Tier 1 fishing mortality recommendation in two ways: 1) by the assumption about \\(\\sigma_R\\) (smaller values increase the “precision” of \\(F_{MSY}\\)) and 2) by having most of the data far from the origin and hence having steepness affected observations that are distant from the origin. We provided an illustration of this in an external simulation. In the 2023 assessment, \\(\\sigma_R\\) was specified at 1.0 as a precautionary measure and seek guidance on best practice given the direct management implication under Tier 1.\nIncorporating the natural mortality at age and year from CEATTLE had a modest impact on the SRR because the recruitment scales higher.\nThe model code was updated to work as an operating model so that a full-feedback simulation loop could be used to test different management procedures.\nPresently the ecosystem factors that affect the pollock TAC are mostly related to the constraint due to the 2-Mt cap. We attempt to elaborate more directly on the ecosystem aspect by developing a parallel catch guideline that is intended to have some aspect of the role pollock plays in the ecosystem. We contrast that with historical patterns of catch. Additionally, we consider multi-species mass-balance projections under scenarios where catch projections closer to the maximum permissible are used. This was done using “ecosense” within the package Rpath (courtesy Andy Whitehouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SSC would prefer not to make a risk table adjustment based on the difference from Tier 1 to Tier 3 again during the 2024 assessment cycle. The SSC requests that the next stock assessment bring back a new approach that may include development of a constant buffer based on factors extrinsic to the stock assessment (ecosystem function), or a better representation of the uncertainty in the Tier 1 and control rule calculations such that a reduction from maximum ABC is not needed every year.\n\nWe approached this by first examining the stock recruitment relationship (SRR) and review the assumptions that the SSC has used to classify this stock in Tier 1 of the BSAI FMP. This is covered under a separate request by the SSC detailed below. We also attempted to consider factors that explicitly acknowledge the importance of pollock to the EBS ecosystem. We propose a management procedure that provides stability in the ABC advice each year and tracks historical adjustments as needed during periods of spawning biomass declines below target (where here we propose using a target geared towards 40+ years of experience managing this fishery).\n\nUse posterior distributions from the MCMC to determine probabilities in the risk table and expand the columns in the risk table to include the recommended ABC (and potentially higher values).\n\nWe interpret this request to refer to the decision table included in the assessment and not the risk-table that is standardly produced for all groundfish assessments. Using the posterior distributions to compute probabilities requires some simple code modifications. Since previous results indicated that asymptotic approximations performed similarly near the mode, we had used them as a shortcut method to make the decision table.\n\nIdentify where MLE estimates are being used and where MCMC estimates are being used. Also see the SSC’s General Stock Assessment Comments to include convergence diagnostics any time Bayesian results are reported. If MCMC diagnostics continue to appear adequate, reference points could be calculated using the posterior distribution used, rather than an analytical calculation.\n\nMLE and asymptotic approximations have always been used for advice. Results from sampling the posterior distribution have been used as a comparison and to show inter-relationships. This will require some document-code modifications to do the computations off of the posterior distributions\n\nThe SSC recommends that consideration be given to removal of the Japanese fishery CPUE index (1965-76) from the assessment, because this data set no longer seems to contribute to the assessment. A sensitivity test should be done to evaluate the effects of data removal on the assessment.\n\nWe investigated this and report on it here.\n\nCatch-at-age data provided by foreign fishing agencies in the pre-Magnuson era were not produced using the same aging criteria as the AFSC age-and-growth program. Consideration should be given to removal of these data from the assessment. A sensitivity test should be done to evaluate the effects of data removal on the assessment.\n\nWe also investigated that in this report\n\nDocument the method used for determining the selectivity to use in the forward projections and continue to evaluate projection variability due to selectivity. The SSC appreciates the selectivity retrospective comparison and suggests that it might be helpful to limit the comparison to the projection used in each year against only the most recent (best) estimate of selectivity for that year.\n\nWe have been clear about projection assumptions used for selectivity and will provide an updated retrospective presentation for this year’s assessment. In this report, we evaluated the sensitivity of Tier 1 ABC given different selectivity estimtates from historical annual values.\n\nThe SSC supports the use of posterior predictive distributions, an underutilized tool in fisheries science, but common in other fields. To fully implement this approach to Bayesian model checking the SSC recommends plotting a histogram for each data source of the percentile of the predictive distribution in which each data point lies, noting that in a highly consistent model this histogram would be uniform.\n\nIn Bayesian statistics, evaluating the performance of a model using the percentile of the posterior predictive distribution is a common approach. This process involves comparing observed data to predictions made by the model and we understand the calculations that would be needed but have yet to implement the necessary code. We highlight the approach in a section discussing Bayesian diagnostics in this report.\n\nThere is an apparent shift towards older ages in fisheries and trawl survey selectivity that should be investigated further.\n\nThis is illustrated in the selectivity plots presented in last year’s report. Relative to historical estimates, the shift seems consistent with past years.\n\nThe SSC agrees with the BSAI GPT’s proposal in their presentation to move the multi-species model out of the pollock stock assessment, where it has been included as an appendix since it was first developed. Instead, they suggested it would be a separate chapter listed in parallel with the ESR, as it applies to multiple stocks and informs the ESRs.\n\nTechnically it’s presented as part of the BSAI assessment. Agree that it should be highlighted on its own. In this report we included the age and year specific estimates of natural mortality from CEATTLE.\n\nThe SSC suggests revisiting the treatment of the stock-recruit relationship in the assessment model using recent improvements in modeling approaches and a longer time series that encompasses the recent warm period in the EBS. Recruitment deviates should be from the stock-recruit relationship and should model variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and residual variability. The estimation process should ensure that log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased, resulting in unbiased biomass estimates. If an informative prior is used for steepness, it should be based on a meta-analysis of related species and reflect the uncertainty of that meta-analysis. Further consideration of time periods (as in previous analyses) and the influence of temperature on the stock-recruit relationship may be helpful. The SSC recognizes that there were significant recent analyses in 2016, 2018 and 2020 and is not requesting a repeat of those but a review of previous work would be helpful.\n\nWe examine a model where the SRR applies over all age classes along with a reevaluation of a number of factors that affect the SRR and the \\(F_{MSY}\\) values. We include a few model results where temperature is in the condition of the SRR. We also note that an evaluation of different ‘regimes’ or periods of low or higher recruitment has been presented in the standard assessment for several years (maybe decades?).",

    "text": "2.4 Simulation testing the stock recruitment estimation\nA simple simulation framework was set up to show how patterns of the Ricker SRR can be influenced by the available “points” used in the estimation. We start with the estimates of spawning biomass and recruits from the 2023 accepted model. As in the assessment, we selected the period from 1978-2022 and fit a Ricker SRR. We then replicated the estimation using random error about both the estimate of recruitment and spawning biomass. These “data” were then sampled with replacement. The\n100 sets of data and resulting curves showed that the slope at the origin tends to be higher for these cases (are shown in (Figure 6). Note that these curves differ from the actual assessment since the fitting is done separately (we used the linear regression log recruits-per-spawning biomass vs spawning biomass). The point of this exercise is to show that extrapolating the fitted curves outside of the range of data (i.e., at smaller spawning stock sizes) can lead to very different and positively biased productivity estimates. The slope at the origin is a key parameter in the Ricker SRR and governs productivity estimates and consequently, \\(F_{MSY}\\) estimates. This suggests that applying the SRR estimates for management purposes (in Tier 1) may be inappropriate given this apparent potential for bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Results from simulation-estimation scenarios from the type of data available for EBS pollock, 1978-2022",

We confirm that in past assessments, for the period which the SRR curve was applied, the bias correction term was included. Specifically,\n\\[ \\hat{R}_t = f(B_{t-1}) e^{\\epsilon_t-0.5 \\sigma_R^2} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_R^2)\\). Here the production function (which generates age-1 recruitment) is a function of spawning biomass in the previous year (\\(f(B_{t-1})\\)). Since this function “generates” age-1 recruitment from a lognormal distribution, the basis for this must be scaled accordingly. Therefore the assessment model numbers-at-age one (\\(\\dot{R_t}=N_{1,t}\\)), must account for the bias based on the SRR. This leads to the recruitment component of the negative log-likelihood as\n\\[ -ln(L_{rec}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\chi_t + \\frac{\\sigma^2_R}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2_R} + ln(\\sigma_R) \\right] \\]\nwhere \\(\\chi_t = \\log(\\dot{R}_t) - \\log(\\hat{R}_t)\\). Note that the bias correction term falls within the likelihood because the bias applies to the SRR model estimates. That is, the bias is applied to the SRR model estimates of age-1 recruitment so that the reference points are consistent with the assessment model scale.\nFor this case we evaluated the impact of the \\(\\sigma_R\\) prior on the ABC estimates. Results show that the assessment model as configured indicates a relatively low value is favored (Figure 9). The assumption about a fixed value of this parameter (set to 1.0 in the 2023 assessment) shows that this can impact the ABC estimate (Figure 10). This figure also shows that the problem persists in Tier 2 (and a candidate “Tier 1.5” from an earlier assessment) but that Tier 3 is relatively insensitive.

    "text": "2.7 Evaluating the impact of selectivity assumptions on stock recruitment relationships (SRR)\nTo examine the assumptions about fishery selectivity variability we ran alternative model configurations where selectivity variability was contrasted. In one configuration it was constrained such that the fishing mortality was considered completely separable with respect to age and one where there was limited constraint on the selectivity. This later model is similar in nature to traditional VPA models where the catch at age is assumed known precisely. The resulting selectivity patterns are shown in Figure 13. Results showed that very little difference between a freely specified selectivity model (Figure 14) Results comparing the constrained selectivity differed substantially from last year’s configuration (Figure 15).\nThe large differences due to assuming separability also impacts the estimates of the stock recruitment relationship (Figure 16). This figure also dipicts the different magnitude of the recent recruitment and an increased uncertainty. In particular, the 2018 year class is estimated to be much larger in the separable model.\nAnother form of evaluating the selectivity estimates was to simply apply each of the annual selectivity estimates (or partial Fs) from the past 20 years. We note that the base result used the mean selectivity over the recent 2 years; specifically, the mean selectivity for 2021 and 2022 for the 2023 terminal year assessment.\nResults show that the srr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Selectivity-at-age patterns for three models: last-year’s, separable, and VPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Model results comparing last year’s selected model with one where the selectivity is more highly variable over time (VPA).

The model has an option for which specific year to use for “future” selectivity and for the number of years over which an average selection pattern could be used.\nInitial results showed that there could be large and variable impacts on the ABC estimates under the current Tier 1 and for different Tiers (Figure 17). This was presumably due to the fact that the selectivity changes can shift to younger or older ages in some years. However, the SRR curve was insensitive to the selectivity estimate (Figure 18) because the future selectivity pattern is separate from the SRR estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Difference in projected Tiers 1-3 ABC by year of selectivity estimate from the 2023 assessment.

    "text": "7.1 Steps for judging model performance based on the posterior predictive distributions\nAs in past years, we used posterior predictive checks to validate models by confirming simulated data were consistent with the observations. Investigations on how to produce standard figures we highlight those as follows.\nProcess error variances can be estimated jointly with random effects and other parameters when desired, and should be for important model components. After obtaining posterior samples, let’s denote these samples as \\(\\theta_1\\), \\(\\theta_2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\theta_N\\), where N is the number of posterior samples. Next is to generate predictive samples. For each posterior sample \\(\\theta_i\\), generate a predictive sample \\(y_i^{\\text{pred}}\\) from the likelihood function \\(p(y \\mid \\theta_i)\\). These predictive samples form the posterior predictive distribution. This step is repeated for each posterior sample, resulting in a collection of predicted values.\nTo judge model performance, compare the observed data \\(y_{\\text{obs}}\\) with the posterior predictive distribution. A common approach is to use the percentile (or quantile) of the observed data in the posterior predictive distribution.\nFor each observed data point \\(y_{\\text{obs}}\\), calculate its percentile in the corresponding posterior predictive distribution. This is done by determining the proportion of predictive samples that are less than or equal to the observed value.\nGiven M predictive samples \\(y_1^{\\text{pred}}\\), \\(y_2^{\\text{pred}}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(y_M^{\\text{pred}}\\). The percentile p of the observed value \\(y_{\\text{obs}}\\) can be computed as:\n\\(p = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^M \\mathbb{I}(y_j^{\\text{pred}} \\leq y_{\\text{obs}})}{M}\\)\nHere, \\(\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)\\) is an indicator function that returns 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 otherwise. This gives the count the predictive samples are less than or equal to the observed value divided by the total number of samples.\nUnder a well-calibrated model, the observed data should fall uniformly across the range of the posterior predictive distribution. This implies that the percentiles should be roughly uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. A histogram of these percentiles can be evaluated relative to a uniform distribution. Significant deviations from uniformity may indicate model misspecification.\nPosterior predictive checks can also be facilitated by visualizing the posterior predictive distribution. This can includes comparing the observed data’s summary statistics (e.g., mean, variance) relative to those of the posterior predictive distribution.\nUpdating the 2023 model for MCMC runs using ADNUTS, we were able achieve reasonable statistics but some divergent transitions remained. Investigations showed that they were reasonable. Figure 32 shows some of the summary figures related to the MCMC sampling and Figure 33 shows the relationship of the slowest mixing parameters. The result from sampling showed that for the 1340 parameters, there was 1,000 iterations over 8 chains with an average run time per chain of 12 minutes. The minimum effective sample size was 2,756 (36.26%) and and the maximum \\(\\hat{R}\\) was 1.004 with 21 divergences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Diagnostic output for ADNUTS sampling for the 2023 EBS pollock model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: Diagnostic output showing the slow mixing parameters of the 2023 EBS pollock model posterior sampling.",
