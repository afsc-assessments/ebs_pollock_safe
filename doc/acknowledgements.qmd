We thank the scientifically trained observers and the staff of the Fisheries and Monitoring
Division at AFSC for their hard work. The diligence of survey staff who contributed immensely
in collecting samples, especially given these times is exceptional. The AFSC age-and-growth
department is thanked for their continued excellence in promptly processing the samples used
in this assessment. We thank the many colleagues who provided edits and suggestions to
improve this document, in particular, the timely review done by Dr. Melissa Haltuch.
