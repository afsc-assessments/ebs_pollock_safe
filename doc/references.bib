  abstract = {Fisheries scientists use regression models to estimate population quantities, such as biomass or abundance, for use in climate, habitat, stock, and ecosystem assessments. However, these models are sensitive to the chosen probability distribution used to characterize observation error. Here, we introduce the generalized gamma distribution (GGD), which has not been widely used in fisheries science. The GGD has useful properties: (1) it reduces to the lognormal distribution when the shape parameter approaches zero; (2) it reduces to the gamma distribution when the shape and scale parameters are equal; and (3) the coefficient of variation is independent of the mean. We assess the relative performance and robustness of the GGD to estimate biomass density across different observation error types in a simulation experiment. When fit to data generated from the GGD, lognormal, gamma, and Tweedie families, the GGD had low bias and high predictive accuracy. Finally, we fit spatiotemporal index standardization models using the R package sdmTMB to 15 species from three trawl surveys from the Gulf of Alaska and coast of British Columbia, Canada. When the Akaike information criterion (AIC) weight was compared among fits using the lognormal, gamma, and Tweedie families the GGD was the most commonly selected model.},

  abstract = {The vertebrate eye lens grows incrementally, adding layers of elongated, tightly packed lens fiber cells at the outer margin of the lens. With subsequent growth, previously-deposited fiber cells degrade, leaving a region of fully denucleated and organelle-free cells which are responsible for the high transparency and low light scattering characteristics of the lens. The objective of this study was to determine if the horizon separating the gelatinous outer cortex of the lens from its hardened interior occurred at a consistent location within the lens of several teleost and elasmobranch fish species, and could be linked to fiber cell morphology or function. A fixed ratio of 0.69{\textpm}0.01 of hardened eye lens diameter (HD) to overall eye lens diameter (LD) was observed in a broad size range of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) and round ray (Rajella fyllae). The location of the hardened lens horizon was similar to that reported for optical plasticity and spherical aberration, but not that of fiber cell denucleation, suggesting that fiber cell dehydration continues after the loss of internal organelles. Our findings support a previous suggestion that the maintenance of optical quality during fish eye lens growth requires a precisely-fixed HD:LD ratio, while the ubiquity of a fixed ratio across fish taxa may suggest that many fish species possess a common refractive index profile. The linear relationship between HD and fish length should allow fish length to be backcalculated from the diameter of the isolated lens core, thus aiding research using isotope ratios of lens laminae or inner cores to reconstruct early life history events.},

  abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.},

To study transboundary migrations across the US–Russia maritime boundary and explore how climate variability might influence these migrations, four seafloor-mounted echosounder moorings were deployed from July 2019 to August 2020 in the northwestern Bering Sea. The observations indicated that a substantial amount of pollock moves between the US and Russia seasonally, with a period of southeast movement into the US as winter as sea ice forms and northwest movement into Russia in early summer as waters warm. Over the deployment period, 2.3-times more pollock backscatter moved into the US zone in fall and winter than exited the subsequent spring and summer. We hypothesize that the difference in the net movement between regions was driven by pollock moving farther into Russia during the historically warm conditions at the start of deployment period and reduced northwest return migration the following summer when temperatures were relatively cooler. This supports the hypothesis that temperature affects pollock distribution, and that continued warming will lead to a larger proportion of the stock in Russian waters.}",

abstract = {Abstract Having a realistic representation of ecosystems in fisheries models is important in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). While different modelling approaches support EBFM, accounting for trophic interactions and uncertainty in stock dynamics is important for management advice. Multispecies models exist, but are rarely used for assessments. Most stock assessments are single species models and predation is subsumed into natural mortality, which is often an assumed known value. The use of state-space assessment models, which account for stochasticity in unobserved processes (process errors), is increasing. However, many stocks are managed assuming deterministic processes. Little is known of how ignoring predation and process errors in stock assessment can impact the perception of the stocks and therefore fisheries management. We developed an age-structured multispecies operating model that simulated data with errors in observations, recruitment and fish abundance. Four estimation models (EMs) that differed according to whether or not they accounted for predation or process errors were fitted to the simulated data. Relative differences between true and predicted outputs were estimated as a measure of bias. Equilibrium unfished biomass was estimated for each model as a proxy reference point. Ignoring predation had the largest impact on stock perception and resulted in large bias in parameters, derived outputs and absolute or relative reference points. Estimating unobserved processes was not sufficient in limiting the bias when natural mortality was misspecified. Ignoring process errors had limited bias but the bias increased when no contrasts existed in fishing mortality over time. Looking solely at likelihood values to choose among models is misleading and predictive ability could be used to prevent selecting models that overfit the data. Synthesis and applications. Ignoring trophic interactions that occur in marine ecosystems induces bias in stock assessment outputs and results in low model predictive ability with subsequently biased reference points. While it may be difficult to estimate natural mortality when no data exist to inform it, stock managers should remember that, if predation is large, assuming a constant mortality over time and/or age could have large consequences on stock perception and reference point estimates and affect resulting management advice.},

abstract = {Ecosystem modelling is a useful tool for exploring the potential outcomes of policy options and conducting experiments that would otherwise be impractical in the real world. However, ecosystem models have been limited in their ability to engage in the management of living marine resources due in part to high levels of uncertainty in model parameters and model outputs. Additionally, for multispecies or food web models, there is uncertainty about the predator-prey functional response, which can have implications for population dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of large marine food webs in Alaska to parameter uncertainty, including parameters that govern the predator-prey functional response. We use Rpath, an R implementation of the food web modeling program Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE), to conduct a series of mortality-based perturbations to examine the sensitivity and recovery time of higher trophic level groups in the eastern Chukchi Sea, eastern Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska. We use a Monte Carlo approach to generate thousands of plausible ecosystems by drawing parameter sets from the range of uncertainty around the base model parameters. We subjected the ecosystem ensembles to a series of mortality-based perturbations to identify which functional groups the higher trophic level groups are most sensitive to when their mortality was increased, whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation, and how long it took to return to that state. In all three ecosystems, we found that the number of disrupted ensemble food webs was positively related to the biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed functional group, and negatively related to trophic level. The eastern Chukchi Sea was most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups, the eastern Bering Sea was most sensitive to shrimp and walleye pollock, and the Gulf of Alaska was most sensitive to shrimps, pelagic forage fish, and zooplankton. Recovery time to perturbations were generally less than 5 years in all three ecosystems. The recovery times when fish groups were perturbed were generally longer than when benthic invertebrates were perturbed, and recovery times were shortest when it was pelagic invertebrates. The single model ensemble approach produced simulation results that described a range of possible outcomes to the prescribed perturbations and provided a sense for how robust the results are to parameter uncertainty.}

    abstract = { Age-based stock assessments are sometimes rejected by review panels due to large retrospective patterns. When this occurs, data-limited approaches are often used to set catch advice, under the assumption that these simpler methods will not be impacted by the problems causing retrospective patterns in the age-based assessment. This assumption has never been formally evaluated. Closed-loop simulations were conducted where a known source of error caused a retrospective pattern in an age-based assessment. Twelve data-limited methods, an ensemble of a subset of these methods, and a statistical catch-at-age model with retrospective adjustment were all evaluated to examine their ability to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks. Overall, none of the methods evaluated performed best across the scenarios. A number of methods performed consistently poorly, resulting in frequent and intense overfishing and low stock sizes. The retrospective adjusted statistical catch-at-age assessment performed better than a number of the alternatives explored. Thus, using a data-limited approach to set catch advice will not necessarily result in better performance than relying on the age-based assessment with a retrospective adjustment. }

abstract = {Abstract Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) can be used to study evolutionary relationships and trade-offs among species traits. Analysts using PCM may want to (1) include latent variables, (2) estimate complex trait interdependencies, (3) predict missing trait values, (4) condition predicted traits upon phylogenetic correlations and (5) estimate relationships as slope parameters that can be compared with alternative regression methods. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) includes well-documented software for phylogenetic linear models (phylolm), phylogenetic path analysis (phylopath), phylogenetic trait imputation (Rphylopars) and structural equation models (sem), but none of these can simultaneously accomplish all five analytical goals. We therefore introduce a new package phylosem for phylogenetic structural equation models (PSEM) and summarize features and interface. We also describe new analytical options, where users can specify any combination of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Pagel's-δ and Pagel's-λ transformations for species covariance. For the first time, we show that PSEM exactly reproduces estimates (and standard errors) for simplified cases that are feasible in sem, phylopath, phylolm and Rphylopars and demonstrate the approach by replicating a well-known case study involving trade-offs in plant energy budgets.},

abstract = {Echo-integration measurements have been traditionally made from dedicated fisheries survey vessels, but extensive measurements from moorings, autonomous vehicles, and fishing vessels are increasingly available. Processing these data by traditional means developed for well-staffed fisheries surveys can be prohibitively time-consuming, which has limited their use. Automated processing methods exist to efficiently handle these large datasets; however, as compared to post-processing by trained analysts, these methods require substantial expertise and methodological development, and they often produce less certain results. Here, we evaluate the use of subsampling, which takes advantage of the spatial correlation common in many fish populations, to improve the efficiency of traditional processing methods while retaining a high level of precision. We subsampled data from an eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (\emph{{G}adus chalcogrammus)} acoustic-trawl survey and compared estimates of pollock backscatter from subsamples to those from the full survey. Over a survey-wide scale, processing < 5% of the data resulted in estimates within 5% of those from processing the full survey. This suggests that in some applications there may be diminishing returns associated with exhaustively processing large spatially correlated datasets. We present an example that applies this simple approach by subsampling archived echosounder data from chartered fishing vessels to prioritize the areas surveyed in future surveys, which would not have been feasible without subsampling. When averaged values over large scales (e.g. over a survey domain) are required, precise echo integration estimates can be obtained with modest effort by processing relatively small subsamples of a dataset.}

abstract = {The eastern Bering Sea shelf is a productive ecosystem with extensive commercial fisheries. Although the area is well-studied during summer months, little is known about the abundance and distribution of fish and macrozooplankton during periods of seasonal ice cover. The use of an icebreaker during the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) provided a platform for spring acoustic surveys of fish and zooplankton in ice-covered areas for the first time. Icebreaker measurements were complemented with observations from conventional vessels during spring and summer. In spring, very little backscatter from fish (dominated by walleye pollock, \emph{{T}heragra chalcogramma}) was observed in the ice-covered northern areas where near-bottom waters were cold (<∼0.5°C), including areas where walleye pollock are abundant in summer. The majority of fish were observed within 40km (and often slightly inside) the ice edge over similar seafloor depths as in summer. Together, these observations suggest that pollock, a dominant component of the ecosystem, shift their distribution to a more restricted geographic area in spring, following the ice edge southeast along the bathymetry, away from areas of cold water and extensive ice cover, then reoccupying these areas in summer. In contrast, acoustic backscatter attributed to zooplankton (likely dominated by euphausiids) was more evenly distributed, and less restricted by water temperature and ice cover. The implications of this seasonal shift in fish distribution are uncertain, but this may affect predator–prey interactions by reducing overlap of pollock with euphausiids, an important prey source, while increasing overlap of adult and juvenile pollock and potentially increasing cannibalism.}

To evaluate such scenarios, spatially aggregated models were compared with spatially explicit models using simulations. These scenarios were based on hypothetical climate-driven distribution shifts and reductions in mean recruitment of walleye pollock (\emph{{G}adus chalcogrammus)} in the eastern Bering Sea. Results indicate that biomass estimates were reasonably accurate for both types of estimation models and precision improved with the inclusion of tagging data. Bias in some aggregated model scenarios could be attributed to unaccounted-for process errors in annual fishing mortality rates and was reduced when estimating effective sample size or time-varying selectivity. Spatially explicit models that allow estimation of variability in movement and ontogenetic parameters (specified as a random walk process) were shown to be feasible, whereas models that misspecified ontogenetic movement and climate change effects resulted in biased biomass and movement parameter estimates. These results illustrate that more complex models may characterize processes better but may be less robust for management advice. }

abstract = {The southernmost extension of winter ice cover varies interannually and on longer time scales, reflecting large-scale changes in driving forces, especially in the position and intensity of the winter Aleutian Low Pressure System. A conspicuous pattern is alternating warm and cool periods of several years' duration. These variations in sea ice cover are reflected in the character of a subsurface cold pool, formed as stratification isolates the deeper cold waters from surface exchanges. The cold pool is better developed and more extensive in summers that follow deep southward penetration of winter sea ice. Interannual and decadal-scale variations in the distributions of some fish stocks reflect those of ice and thermal conditions. In particular, the distribution of walleye pollock, (\emph{{T}heragra chalcogramma}) varies significantly with multiannual cool and warm years while Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, is only present within the cold pool. The relation among climate variations, sea ice cover, subsurface thermal conditions, and fish distribution provides information on how climate affects marine ecosystems and may also have practical application in predicting fish distributions.},

 abstract = {Seasonal ice cover creates a pool of cold bottom water on the eastern Bering Sea continental shelf each winter. The southern edge of this cold pool, which defines the ecotone between arctic and subarctic communities, has retreated ~230 km northward since the early 1980s. Bottom trawl surveys of fish and invertebrates in the southeastern Bering Sea (1982-2006) show a coincident reorganization in community composition by latitude. Survey catches show community-wide northward distribution shifts, and the area formerly covered by the cold pool has seen increases in total biomass, species richness, and average trophic level as subarctic fauna have colonized newly favorable habitats. Warming climate has immediate management implications, as 57% of variability in commercial snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) catch is explained by winter sea ice extent. Several measures of community distribution and structure show linear relationships with bottom temperature, suggesting warming climate as the primary cause of changing biogeography. However, residual variability in distribution not explained by climate shows a strong temporal trend, suggesting that internal community dynamics also contribute to changing biogeography. Variability among taxa in their response to temperature was not explained by commercial status or life history traits, suggesting that species-specific responses to future warming will be difficult to predict.},

We illustrate the concepts by applying them to yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean.}

abstract = {Bayesian inference has long been recognized as useful for fisheries stock assessments but it is less common than maximum likelihood approaches due to long run times and a lack of good practices. Recent computational advances leave developing good practices and user-friendly interfaces as the most important hurdles to wider use of this powerful statistical paradigm. Here, I argue that the modern Bayesian workflow proposed by Gelman et al. (2020) should form the basis for proposed good practices in fisheries sciences. Their workflow is a conceptual roadmap for iterative model building which includes the philosophical role of priors and how to apply statistical tools to construct them, how to validate and compare models, and how to overcome computational problems. Adapted for stock assessment, this leads to the following good practices for analysts. Diagnostics from multiple no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) chains (the recommended MCMC algorithm) should pass and be reported, specifically that the potential scale reduction Rˆ is <1.01 and the effective sample size is >400 for all parameters, and there are no NUTS divergences. When direct a priori information is unavailable on parameters, use prior predictive checking to build, assess, and adjust priors to enforce desired constraints on complexity, or to conform to a priori expectations or physical/biological limitations on derived quantities. Use posterior predictive checks to validate models by confirming simulated data and summaries (e.g., variance of compositional data) are similar to the observed counterparts. Process error variances can be estimated jointly with random effects and other parameters when desired, and should be for important model components. An approximate cross-validation technique called PSIS-LOO is the most practical tool for model selection, but can also provide important insights into model deficiencies. I also recommended that model developers build and parameterize models to have minimal parameter correlations and marginal variances close to one, have options for diverse (multivariate) priors, do predictive modeling, and ensure that the tools comprising a workflow are accessible and straightforward for routine use. I review, adapt, and illustrate a Bayesian workflow on AD Model Builder and Stock Synthesis models, but these good practices apply to models from any software platform, including Template Model Builder and Stan. Finally, I argue that the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms complement each other, with both helping analysts better understand different aspects of their models and data. Wider adoption of Bayesian methods using the good practices proposed here would therefore lead to improved scientific advice used to manage fisheries.}

abstract = {Environmental changes are predicted to impact fish ecology; specifically, the phenology of spawning and larval settlement, resulting adult and larval movement, and ultimately seasonal habitat utilization. Hence, warm or cold environmental conditions may cause early or late seasonal movement among habitats. However, resource surveys are typically designed to occur at approximately the same time each year, and this mismatch in timing between survey sampling and fish movement can cause a different proportion of population biomass to be available to the survey in different years. In this study, we demonstrate an application to minimize such impacts using yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) in the eastern Bering Sea as a case study. We employedfishery-dependent catch-and-effort (also called catch per unit effort (CPUE)) datacollected by observers on commercial vessels, which covered the months of March-October (whereas survey data were limited to June-August). We built a seasonal spatio-temporal model so that seasonal distribution could be used to better explain summer survey availability and movement timing as impacted by interannual temperature changes. Our results highlight (i) spawning movement phenology occurs earlier during warm years than cold years, (ii) spatial distribution is more constrained and biomass is lower during cold years than warm years, (iii) fish were more available to the summer survey during warm years than cold years, and (iv) phenology differed by sex with males staying longer on the spawning grounds than females. Finally, we computed an overlap index between the survey area and fishery CPUE data to be used as a catchability covariate within the yellowfin sole stock assessment. This index confirmed the changes in relative availability of this species by year as presently used in the assessment.}

abstract = {Stock assessment models are often used to inform fisheries management and need therefore to be thoroughly validated. Different diagnostics exist to validate models including the analysis of standardized residuals. Standardized residuals are commonly calculated by subtracting prediction from the observation and dividing the result with the estimated standard deviation (i.e., Pearson residuals). Many currently applied stock assessment models fit to compositional observations (e.g., age, length or stock compositions) using multivariate distributions. These distributions create correlation between observations, which are propagated in the residuals if estimated as Pearson. This study shows that using Pearson residuals to analyze goodness of the fit, when data are fitted using a multivariate distribution, is incorrect and one-step-ahead (OSA) or forecast quantile residuals should be used instead. For such distributions, OSA residuals are independent and standard normally distributed for correctly specified models. This study describes the calculation of OSA residuals specifically to de-correlate compositional observations for the multivariate distributions most commonly used in assessment models. This allows composition observations to be evaluated with the same statistical rigor as residuals from uncorrelated observations. This also prevents the possible wrong interpretation of Pearson residuals and the rejection of a correct model. We have developed an R-package that estimates OSA residuals externally to the model for models that do not include random processes. For models that use random processes, the distributions are now developed in Template Model Builder and explained in detail here for internal use.}

abstract = {Abstract Fisheries scientists and managers must track rapid shifts in fish spatial distribution to mitigate stakeholder conflict and optimize survey designs, and these spatial shifts result in part from animal movement. Information regarding animal movement can be obtained from selection experiments, tagging studies, flux through movement gates (e.g. acoustic arrays), fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), resource surveys and genetic/chemical markers. However, there are few accessible approaches to combine these data types while accounting for spatially correlated residual patterns. We therefore discuss a movement model involving diffusion (random movement), taxis (movement towards preferred habitat) and advection (passive drift following ocean currents). We specifically outline how these movement processes can be fitted to data while discretizing space and time and estimating non-linear habitat preferences using environmental layers as well as spatial process errors. Finally, we introduce an R package, ATM, by fitting the model to bottom trawl survey, longline fishery and tagging data for Pacific cod (\emph{{G}adus macrocephalus})  in the Bering Sea during winter/summer seasons from 1982 to 2019. Combining data types predicts an increasing proportion of cod residing in the northern Bering Sea from 2013 to 2019, and estimates are informative in a recent stock assessment model. We fit sensitivity analyses by dropping tag, survey or fishery data, and this analysis shows that tagging data are necessary to identify diffusion rates, while survey data are informative about movement among biogeographic strata. This “hybrid” species distribution model can help explain poleward movement, project distributions under future climate conditions and evaluate alternative tag-deployment scenarios to optimize tagging designs.},

For example, stock assessments often assume that body weight-at-age (i.e. size) is constant across the stocks’ range, and may thereby miss important spatio-temporal patterns. This is becoming increasingly relevant given climate-driven distributional shifts, because samples for estimating size-at-age can be spatially unbalanced and lead to biases when extrapolating into unsampled areas. Here, we jointly analysed data on the local abundance and size of walleye pollock ({\emph{Gadus chalcogrammus}}) in the Bering Sea, to demonstrate a tractable first step in expanding spatially unbalanced size-at-age samples, while incorporating fine-scale spatial and temporal variation for inclusion in stock assessments. The data come from NOAA’s bottom trawl survey data and were evaluated using a multivariate spatio-temporal statistical model. We found extensive variation in size-at-age at fine spatial scales, though specific patterns differed between age classes. In addition to persistent spatial patterns, we also documented year-to-year differences in the spatial patterning of size-at-age. Intra-annual variation in the population-level size-at-age (used to generate the size-at-age matrix in the stock assessment) was largely driven by localized changes in fish size, while shifts in species distribution had a smaller effect. The spatio-temporal size-at-age matrix led to marginal improvement in the stock assessment fit to the survey biomass index. Results from our case study suggest that accounting for spatially unbalanced sampling improved stock assessment consistency. Additionally, it improved our understanding on the dynamics of how local and population-level demographic processes interact. As climate change affects fish distribution and growth, integrating spatiotemporally explicit size-at-age processes with anticipated environmental conditions may improve stock-assessment forecasts used to set annual harvest limits.}",

abstract = {Abstract Many mobile marine taxa are changing their distributions in response to climate change. Such movements pose a challenge to fisheries monitoring and management, particularly in systems where climate-adaptive and ecosystem-based management objectives are emphasized. While shifts in species distributions can be discerned from long-term fisheries-independent monitoring data, distilling coherent patterns across space and time from such datasets can be challenging, particularly for transboundary stocks. One approach for identifying dominant patterns of spatiotemporal variation that has been widely used in physical atmospheric and oceanographic studies is empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, wherein spatiotemporal variation is separated into time-series of annual factor loadings and spatial response maps. Here, we apply an extension of EOF analysis that has been modified for compatibility with biological sampling data to a combined US–Russian fisheries-independent survey dataset that spans the eastern (United States) and western (Russia) Bering Sea shelf to estimate dominant patterns of spatiotemporal variation for 10 groundfish species at a shelf-wide scale. EOF identified one axis of variability that was coherent with the extent of cold (≤0°C) near-bottom waters (the cold pool) previously shown to be a key influence on species distributions and ecosystem structure for the Bering Sea. However, the leading axis of variability identified by our EOF analysis was characterized by low frequency changes in the distributions of several species over longer time scales. Our analysis has important implications for predicting variation in species distributions over time and demonstrates a widely applicable method for leveraging combined fisheries-independent survey datasets to characterize community-level responses to ecosystem change at basin-wide scales.}

abstract = {Although highly variable in time and space, predation remains the greatest source of mortality for juvenile and lower trophic-level fishes. As such, predation can have substantial and long-term effects on the dynamics of these prey. {Gulf of Alaska} walleye pollock ({\emph{Gadus chalcogrammus}})  has shown considerable variability in biomass over the past four decades. During this same time, the demersal fish community transitioned from being dominated by pollock to a system comprised primarily of upper trophic-level predators. We estimated time-varying predation mortality to better understand its effects on the population dynamics of pollock in this currently “top heavy” system. Our index of predation accounted for spatiotemporal variation in predator biomass, bioenergetics-based rations, and age-specific proportions of pollock consumed (1990–2019). To evaluate population-level impacts of predation, we included an index of removals as part of the stock assessment model. This formulation allowed for non-annual data inputs and included a proportionality constant with which to scale predation. Age-specific natural mortality was allowed to vary according to a penalized random walk. We found that natural mortality ranged from 37% higher to 17% lower than the long-term mean. Resulting estimates of total pollock biomass differed by as much as 37% relative to a model without time-varying natural mortality, though the maximum difference for exploitable biomass was only 14%. Using an empirically-derived predation index to modify constant natural mortality allows stock assessment scientists to evaluate impacts of time-varying predation on assessed species. This approach provides a relatively simple way of incorporating ecological information into single-species stock assessments and may reduce bias compared to conventional models that do not account for changes in predation mortality. Notably, including predation mortality in single-species assessments may help identify inconsistencies in biomass estimates that warrant further consideration.}

Although there is evidence for time, age, and cohort-specific patterns in the variation of various components within stock assessment (e.g., selectivity, growth), methods are sparsely documented or are lacking to simultaneously estimate autocorrelation over time, among ages, and by cohort while also quantifying residual variation. We demonstrate an approach that facilitates the simultaneous estimation of autocorrelation for time, age, and cohort correlations, and provide two options to estimate the pointwise variance of this process (termed conditional and marginal variance). Using eastern {Bering Sea} walleye pollock ({\emph{Gadus chalcogrammus}})  as a case-study, we develop factorial model formulations to demonstrate differences in predicted weight-at-age values from models that estimate different combinations of correlation parameters along three axes (age, year, cohort). We show that traditional model selection tools can be used to identify the relative evidence for, and magnitude of, age, time, and cohort correlations, and demonstrate that this method can be easily integrated as a routine option within next-generation stock assessments. Code to replicate our analysis is provided in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/chengmatt/GMRF_WAA), and includes a Template Model Builder function for assembling the precision matrix to facilitate easy adoption in other software packages.}

Data from this bootstrap estimator were then used to evaluate the influence of alternative sampling rates and methods on uncertainty in estimates of the overfishing limit (OFL) calculated using stock assessment models. For dusky rockfish (Sebastes variabilis) and Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), a 10\% decrease in the number of tows sampled upon led to a predicted 5\%–6\% increase in the CV of OFL (log–log slope = −0.576 to −0.486), which was greater than the 0\%–2\% increase from a 10\% decrease in otoliths-per-tow (log–log slope = −0.238 to −0.029). Application of this approach across all stocks monitored in the survey of interest is required to identify which stocks (i) benefit the most from increased sampling of ageing structures or (ii) cost the least in terms of OFL uncertainty owing to reduced sampling. }

  abstract = {This paper revisits topics addressed in two previous papers on data weighting in fisheries stock assessment models: the first was general (Francis, 2011; Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68, 1124\textendash 1138); the second considered the related problem of finding the best likelihood for composition data (Francis, 2014; Fish. Res. 151, 70\textendash 84). In the light of subsequent literature and experience, four topics seemed in need of increased emphasis or elaboration. (1) For composition data, it is better to think in terms of ``right-weighting'' (i.e., weighting that is statistically appropriate) than ``down-weighting''. (2) The sensitivity of some assessments to changes in weighting can sometimes be reduced by restructuring to reduce model misspecification; this is a good idea, but should be seen as complementary to data weighting, rather than an alternative to it. (3) It seems typical that more than half of the variance of composition residuals arises from process error (arising from model misspecification) rather than observation error. (4) Changing the likelihood for composition data from the multinomial to the Dirichlet-multinomial has some advantages but is not without problems. Some new topics are discussed: most iterative reweighting of composition data is multiplicative, but additive methods deserve consideration; data weighting is more complicated in state-space models; catch data should not be subject to data weighting; there are significant disadvantages in structuring age-related observations of fishery and survey catches as frequencies, rather than compositions (i.e., as numbers, rather than proportions); methods of weighting three additional data types (conditional age at length, tagging abundance; and tagging length-increment) are described.},

  abstract = {The conclusions drawn from fisheries stock assessment models can depend strongly on the relative weights assigned to different data sets. However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

  abstract = {A typical assumption used in most fishery stock assessments is that natural mortality (M) is constant across time and age. However, M is rarely constant in reality as a result of the combined impacts of exploitation history, predation, environmental factors, and physiological trade-offs. Misspecification or poor estimation of M can lead to bias in quantities estimated using stock assessment methods, potentially resulting in biased estimates of fishery reference points and catch limits, with the magnitude of bias being influenced by life history and trends in fishing mor-tality. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the ability of statistical age-structured population models to estimate spawning-stock biomass, fishing mortality, and total allowable catch when the true M was age-invariant, but time-varying. Configurations of the stock assessment method, implemented in Stock Synthesis, included a single age-and time-invariant M parameter, specified at one of the three levels (high, medium, and low) or an estimated M. The min\textendash{} max (i.e. most robust) approach to specifying M when it is thought to vary across time was to estimate M. The least robust approach for most scenarios examined was to fix M at a high value, suggesting that the consequences of misspecifying M are asymmetric.},

  abstract = {Assessment of the status of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) by Australia and Japan has used a method (ADAPT) that imposes a number of structural restrictions, and is similar to methods used for a number of stocks world-wide. A flexible method for assessment of the SBT population is presented that is much less restrictive and has potentially wide applicability. The three key features are: (1) all fitting to data is within the context of maximum likelihood, (2) catch-at-age data are not assumed to be without error (as in existing methods), but rather to be random variables, while age-specific selectivity is allowed to change over time within the bounds of specific structure, and (3) autocorrelation in recruitment processes is considered within the likelihood framework of the model. While the results suggest the stock has been depleted considerably from its virgin biomass, and are generally consistent with previous assessments, they also indicate that it is not as much below the biomass that will produce maximum suitable yield as previously estimated and that the extent of stock rebuilding necessary may not be as large as has been argued. The available data are shown to provide little information on the steepness parameter of the stock-recruitment function, and hence on sustainable catch levels for the stock. \textcopyright{} 2003 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},
