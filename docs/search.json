    "text": "The work presented below was based on the same data sets used in the 2023 assessment. The model was updated so that it could handle a number of requests from the SSC. We enhanced the capability of the code to deal with some alternative hypotheses of factors that affect the stock recruitment relationship (SRR). We stepped through a number of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the stock-recruitment relationship (SRR) and the steepness of the SRR. We also evaluated the impact of including the natural mortality-at-age estimates from CEATTLE model.\n\n\n\nSome research has indicated that the value of \\(\\sigma_R\\) can be reasonably well estimated in both traditional stock assessment models and in state-space versions (e.g., Stock and Miller (2021)). Based on our analysis, we confirm that estimates appear reasonable. However, we caution about applying \\(\\sigma_R\\) estimates blindly in management settings. This is because for EBS pollock, the SRR is heavily influenced by estimates of spawning biomass being mainly larger than \\(B_{MSY}\\) (to the right of \\(B_{MSY}\\); far from the origin of the SRR curve) instead of spawning biomass estimates that are much smaller than \\(B_{MSY}\\) (near the origin, which would better inform estimates of steepness). We show that the SRR is thus linked to the Tier 1 fishing mortality recommendation in two ways: 1) by the assumption about \\(\\sigma_R\\) (smaller values increase the “precision” of \\(F_{MSY}\\)) and 2) by having most of the data far from the origin means estimating steepness becomes less certain and possibly unreliable. We provided an illustration of this in an external simulation. In the 2023 assessment, \\(\\sigma_R\\) was specified at 1.0 as a precautionary measure. We seek guidance on \\(\\sigma_R\\) approaches and general treatment of the SRR given the direct management implications under Tier 1.\nIncorporating the natural mortality-at-age and year from CEATTLE had a modest impact on the SRR because the recruitment scales were higher.\nThe model code was updated to work as an operating model so that a full-feedback simulation loop could be used to test different management procedures.\nPresently the ecosystem factors that affect the pollock TAC are mostly related to the constraint due to the 2-Mt cap. We attempt to elaborate more directly on the ecosystem aspect by developing a parallel catch guideline that is intended to take into account the role pollock plays in the ecosystem. We contrast this alternative guideline (in the form of “advice”) with historical patterns of catch. Additionally, we consider multi-species mass-balance projections under scenarios where catch projections closer to the maximum permissible are used. This was done using “ecosense” within the package Rpath (Aydin, Lucey, and Gaichas (2024); courtesy Andy Whitehouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SSC would prefer not to make a risk table adjustment based on the difference from Tier 1 to Tier 3 again during the 2024 assessment cycle. The SSC requests that the next stock assessment bring back a new approach that may include development of a constant buffer based on factors extrinsic to the stock assessment (ecosystem function), or a better representation of the uncertainty in the Tier 1 and control rule calculations such that a reduction from maximum ABC is not needed every year.\n\nWe approached this by first examining the stock recruitment relationship (SRR) and review the assumptions that the SSC has used to classify this stock in Tier 1 of the BSAI FMP. This is covered under a separate request by the SSC detailed below. We also attempted to consider factors that explicitly acknowledge the importance of pollock to the EBS ecosystem. We propose a management procedure that provides stability in the ABC advice each year and tracks historical adjustments as needed during periods of spawning biomass declines below target (where here we propose using a target geared towards 40+ years of experience managing this fishery).\n\nUse posterior distributions from the MCMC to determine probabilities in the risk table and expand the columns in the risk table to include the recommended ABC (and potentially higher values).\n\nWe interpret this request to refer to the decision table included in the assessment and not the risk-table that is standardly produced for all groundfish assessments. Using the posterior distributions to compute probabilities requires some simple code modifications. Since previous results indicated that asymptotic approximations performed similarly near the mode, we had used them as a shortcut method to make the decision table.\n\nIdentify where MLE estimates are being used and where MCMC estimates are being used. Also see the SSC’s General Stock Assessment Comments to include convergence diagnostics any time Bayesian results are reported. If MCMC diagnostics continue to appear adequate, reference points could be calculated using the posterior distribution used, rather than an analytical calculation.\n\nMLE and asymptotic approximations have always been used for advice. Results from sampling the posterior distribution have been used as a comparison and to show inter-relationships. This will require some document-code modifications to do the computations off of the posterior distributions\n\nThe SSC recommends that consideration be given to removal of the Japanese fishery CPUE index (1965-76) from the assessment, because this data set no longer seems to contribute to the assessment. A sensitivity test should be done to evaluate the effects of data removal on the assessment.\n\nWe investigated this and report on it here.\n\nCatch-at-age data provided by foreign fishing agencies in the pre-Magnuson era were not produced using the same aging criteria as the AFSC age-and-growth program. Consideration should be given to removal of these data from the assessment. A sensitivity test should be done to evaluate the effects of data removal on the assessment.\n\nWe investigated this and report on it here.\n\nDocument the method used for determining the selectivity to use in the forward projections and continue to evaluate projection variability due to selectivity. The SSC appreciates the selectivity retrospective comparison and suggests that it might be helpful to limit the comparison to the projection used in each year against only the most recent (best) estimate of selectivity for that year.\n\nWe will be clearer about projection assumptions especially for selectivity. In this report we show the sensitivity of selectivity assumption and evaluated the sensitivity of Tier 1 ABC estimates given different selectivity estimates from historical annual values. In the next draft we will update how different selectivity assumptions perform based on an updated retrospective presentation for this year’s assessment.\n\nThe SSC supports the use of posterior predictive distributions, an underutilized tool in fisheries science, but common in other fields. To fully implement this approach to Bayesian model checking the SSC recommends plotting a histogram for each data source of the percentile of the predictive distribution in which each data point lies, noting that in a highly consistent model this histogram would be uniform.\n\nIn Bayesian statistics, evaluating the performance of a model using the percentile of the posterior predictive distribution is a common approach. This process involves comparing observed data to predictions made by the model and we understand the calculations that would be needed but have yet to implement the necessary code. We highlight the approach in a section discussing Bayesian diagnostics in this report.\n\nThere is an apparent shift towards older ages in fisheries and trawl survey selectivity that should be investigated further.\n\nThis is illustrated in the selectivity plots presented in last year’s report. Relative to historical estimates, the shift seems consistent with past years.\n\nThe SSC agrees with the BSAI GPT’s proposal in their presentation to move the multi-species model out of the pollock stock assessment, where it has been included as an appendix since it was first developed. Instead, they suggested it would be a separate chapter listed in parallel with the ESR, as it applies to multiple stocks and informs the ESRs.\n\nTechnically it’s presented as part of the BSAI assessment. Agree that it should be highlighted on its own. In this report we included the age and year specific estimates of natural mortality from CEATTLE.\n\nThe SSC suggests revisiting the treatment of the stock-recruit relationship in the assessment model using recent improvements in modeling approaches and a longer time series that encompasses the recent warm period in the EBS. Recruitment deviates should be from the stock-recruit relationship and should model variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and residual variability. The estimation process should ensure that log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased, resulting in unbiased biomass estimates. If an informative prior is used for steepness, it should be based on a meta-analysis of related species and reflect the uncertainty of that meta-analysis. Further consideration of time periods (as in previous analyses) and the influence of temperature on the stock-recruit relationship may be helpful. The SSC recognizes that there were significant recent analyses in 2016, 2018 and 2020 and is not requesting a repeat of those but a review of previous work would be helpful.\n\nWe examine a model where the SRR applies over all age classes along with a reevaluation of a number of factors that affect the SRR and the \\(F_{MSY}\\) values. We include a few model results where temperature is in the condition of the SRR. We also note that an evaluation of different ‘regimes’ or periods of low or higher recruitment has been presented in the standard assessment for several years (maybe decades?).",

We start with the estimates of spawning biomass and recruits from the 2023 accepted model. As in the assessment, we selected the period from 1978-2022 and fit a Ricker SRR. We then replicated the estimation using random error about both the estimate of recruitment and spawning biomass. These “data” were then sampled with replacement. The\n100 sets of data and resulting curves showed that the slope at the origin tends to be higher for these cases (are shown in (Figure 6). Note that these curves differ from the actual assessment since the fitting is done separately (we used the linear regression log recruits-per-spawning biomass vs spawning biomass). The point of this exercise is to show that extrapolating the fitted curves outside of the range of data (i.e., at smaller spawning stock sizes) can lead to very different and positively biased productivity estimates. The slope at the origin is a key parameter in the Ricker SRR and governs productivity estimates and consequently, \\(F_{MSY}\\) estimates. This suggests that applying the SRR estimates for management purposes (in Tier 1) may be inappropriate given this apparent potential for bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Results from simulation-estimation scenarios from the type of data available for EBS pollock, 1978-2022.

    "text": "Specified variability about the SRR\nThe SSC requested that we ensure that the bias correction is applied in the application of fitting the SRR. We confirm that in past assessments, for the period which the SRR curve was applied, the bias correction term was included. Specifically,\n\\[ \\hat{R}_t = f(B_{t-1}) e^{\\epsilon_t-0.5 \\sigma_R^2} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_R^2)\\). Here the production function (which generates age-1 recruitment) is a function of spawning biomass in the previous year (\\(f(B_{t-1})\\)). Since this function “generates” age-1 recruitment from a lognormal distribution, the basis for this must be scaled accordingly. Therefore the assessment model numbers-at-age one (\\(\\dot{R_t}=N_{1,t}\\)), must account for the bias based on the SRR. This leads to the recruitment component of the negative log-likelihood as\n\\[ -ln(L_{rec}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\chi_t + \\frac{\\sigma^2_R}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2_R} + ln(\\sigma_R) \\right] \\]\nwhere \\(\\chi_t = \\log(\\dot{R}_t) - \\log(\\hat{R}_t)\\). Note that the bias correction term falls within the likelihood because the bias applies to the SRR model estimates. That is, the bias is applied to the SRR model estimates of age-1 recruitment so that the reference points are consistent with the assessment model scale.\nFor this case we evaluated the impact of the \\(\\sigma_R\\) prior on the ABC estimates. Results show that the assessment model as configured indicates a relatively low value is favored (Figure 9). The assumption about a fixed value of this parameter (set to 1.0 in the 2023 assessment) shows that this can impact the ABC estimate (Figure 10). This figure also shows that the problem persists in Tier 2 along with a candidate hybrid Tier 2 approach from the 2021 assessment (here labeled as “Tier 1.5”)1 but Tier 3 is insensitive.

    "text": "Evaluating the impact of selectivity assumptions on stock recruitment relationships (SRR)\nTo examine the assumptions about fishery selectivity variability we ran alternative model configurations where selectivity variability was contrasted. In one configuration it was constrained such that the fishing mortality was considered completely separable with respect to age and one where there was limited constraint on the selectivity. This later model is similar in nature to traditional VPA models where the catch-at-age is assumed to be known precisely. The resulting selectivity patterns are shown in Figure 13. Results showed minor differences between the model with selectivity allowed to be freely variable and the 2023 assessment (Figure 14). Results comparing the constrained (“separable”) selectivity differed substantially from last year’s configuration (Figure 15; see Figure 13 for differences in selectivity patterns).\nThe large differences due to assuming separability also impacts the estimates of the stock recruitment relationship (Figure 16). This figure also depicts the different magnitude of the recent recruitment and the corresponding increased uncertainty. In particular, the 2018 year class is estimated to be much larger in the separable model.\nAnother form of evaluating the selectivity estimates was to simply apply each of the annual selectivity estimates (or partial Fs) from the past 20 years. We note that the base result used the mean selectivity over the recent 2 years; specifically, the mean selectivity for 2021 and 2022 for the 2023 terminal year assessment.\nResults show that the SRR also varied slightly when a constant selectivity was assumed (Figure 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Selectivity-at-age patterns for three models: last-year’s, separable, and VPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Model results comparing last year’s selected model with one where the selectivity is more highly variable over time (VPA).

Note that the vertical bars represent the 95% confidence intervals for the age-1 recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor another set of experiments, we evaluated the SRR curve given the past 20 years of selectivity estimates. The model has an option for which specific year to use for “future” selectivity and for the number of years over which an average selection pattern could be used.\nInitial results showed that there could be large and variable impacts on the ABC estimates under the current Tier 1 and for different Tiers (Figure 17). This was presumably due to the fact that the selectivity changes can shift to younger or older ages in some years. However, the SRR curve was insensitive to the selectivity estimate (Figure 18) because the future selectivity pattern is separate from the SRR estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Difference in projected Tiers 1-3 ABC by year of selectivity estimate from the 2023 assessment.

    "text": "Steps for judging model performance based on the posterior predictive distributions\nAs in past years, we used posterior predictive checks to validate models by confirming simulated data were consistent with the observations. Here we attempt to expand on approaches that might be useful for evaluating models. We outline a summary of what we found here in order to improve on our diagnostics for assessments. After obtaining posterior samples, let’s denote these samples as \\(\\theta_1\\), \\(\\theta_2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\theta_N\\), where N is the number of posterior samples. The next step is to generate predictive samples. For each posterior sample \\(\\theta_i\\), generate a predictive sample \\(y_i^{\\text{pred}}\\) from the likelihood function \\(p(y \\mid \\theta_i)\\). These predictive samples form the posterior predictive distribution. This step is repeated for each posterior sample, resulting in a collection of predicted values.\nTo judge model performance, compare the observed data \\(y_{\\text{obs}}\\) with the posterior predictive distribution. A common approach is to use the percentile (or quantile) of the observed data in the posterior predictive distribution.\nFor each observed data point \\(y_{\\text{obs}}\\), calculate its percentile in the corresponding posterior predictive distribution. This is done by determining the proportion of predictive samples that are less than or equal to the observed value.\nGiven M predictive samples \\(y_1^{\\text{pred}}\\), \\(y_2^{\\text{pred}}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(y_M^{\\text{pred}}\\). The percentile p of the observed value \\(y_{\\text{obs}}\\) can be computed as:\n\\(p = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^M \\mathbb{I}(y_j^{\\text{pred}} \\leq y_{\\text{obs}})}{M}\\)\nHere, \\(\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)\\) is an indicator function that returns 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 otherwise. This gives the count of predictive samples that are less than or equal to the observed value divided by the total number of samples.\nUnder a well-calibrated model, the observed data should fall uniformly across the range of the posterior predictive distribution. This implies that the percentiles should be roughly uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. A histogram of these percentiles can be evaluated relative to a uniform distribution. Significant deviations from uniformity may indicate model misspecification.\nPosterior predictive checks can also be facilitated by visualizing the posterior predictive distribution. This can include comparing the observed data’s summary statistics (e.g., mean, variance) relative to those of the posterior predictive distribution.\nUpdating the 2023 model for MCMC runs using ADNUTS, we were able to achieve reasonable statistics but some divergent transitions remained. Investigations showed that they were reasonable. Figure 32 shows some of the summary figures related to the MCMC sampling and Figure 33 shows relationships between the slowest mixing parameters. The result from sampling showed that for the 1340 parameters, there were 1,000 iterations over 8 chains with an average run time per chain of 12 minutes. The minimum effective sample size was 2,756 (36.26%) and and the maximum \\(\\hat{R}\\) was 1.004 with 21 divergences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Diagnostic output for ADNUTS sampling for the 2023 EBS pollock model.

    "text": "A statistical age-structured assessment model conceptually outlined in Fournier and Archibald (1982) and like Methot’s (1990) stock synthesis model was applied over the period 1964–2023. A technical description is presented in the “EBS Pollock Model Description” appendix. The analysis was first introduced in the 1996 SAFE report and compared to the cohort analyses that had been used previously and was later documented in Ianelli and Fournier (1998). The model was written in ADMB—a library for non-linear estimation and statistical applications (Fournier et al. 2012). The data updated from last year’s analyses include:\n\nThe 2022 fishery age composition data were added\nThe catch biomass estimates were updated through to the current year\nThe 2023 bottom-trawl survey index, weight, and age composition data were revised and added\nThe 2023 acoustic-trawl survey index, weight, and preliminary age composition data were added\nThe AVO backscatter data collected opportunistically from the 2022 bottom trawl survey and post processed into the AVO backscatter index were included.\n\nA simplified version of the assessment (with mainly the same data and likelihood-fitting method) is included as a supplemental multi-species assessment model. As presented since 2016, it allows for trophic interactions among key prey and predator species and for pollock, and it can be used to evaluate age and time-varying natural mortality estimates in addition to alternative catch scenarios and management targets (see this volume: EBS multi-species model).\n\n\n\nIn the 2019 assessment, the spatio-temporal model fit to BTS CPUE data including stations from the NBS was expanded using the VAST methods detailed in Thorson (2018). This data treatment was included as a model alternative and adopted for ABC/OFL specifications by the SSC in 2020 along with other modifications including a spatio-temporal treatment of the age composition data. This year, we used the same model configuration and simply examined the influence of additional data that became available this year. For projections we added the ability to test alternative Tier scenarios. The current base model is Model 20.0a, which was adopted last year by the SSC, and which differed from the previous base model (Model 16.2) in that it included the 2020 USV acoustic biomass estimate as an extension of the standard AT survey biomass time series and excluded the 1978 year class from the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship. We examined the following alternative models:\nIn an effort to test different stock assessment software, we adopted the pollock data and used some of the model software that was simulation tested in Li et al. (2021). While preliminary, the results were consistent with the bespoke model used here. However, the impact of missing features in the more generalized models tested in this paper requires more investigation. Specifically, the bespoke model used here includes an informed fixed-effects model for projecting weight-at-age and uses a covariance matrix for index time series that is unavailable in the models tested in Li et al. (2021).\n\n\n\nSample sizes for age-composition data were re-evaluated in 2016 against the trade-off with flexibility in time and age varying selectivity. In subsequent assessment years the values have changed significantly from the 4-periods of fishery data from which these weights were applied and calculated. Principally, this work resulted in tuning the recent era (1991-present year) to an average sample sizes of 350 for the fishery and then using estimated values for the period 1978-1990 and as earlier (Table \\(\\ref{tab:input_n}\\)). We assumed average values of 100 and 50 for the BTS and ATS data, respectively with inter-annual variability reflecting the variability in the number of hauls sampled for ages. This year we re-evaluated one-step tuning as a sensitivity following Francis 2011 (equation TA1.8, hereafter referred to as Francis weights).\nRecent work has shown ways to improve estimation schemes that deal with the interaction between flexibility in fishery selectivity and statistical properties of composition data sample size. Specifically, the Dirichlet-multinomial using either Laplace approximation (Thorson et al., 2015) or adnuts (Monnahan and Kristensen, 2018) should be implemented (e.g., as shown by Xu et al., 2020). We hope to evaluate these and alternatives in the coming year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe baseline model specification has been to use constant natural mortality rates at age (M=0.9, 0.45, and 0.3 for ages 1, 2, and 3+ respectively (Wespestad and Terry 1984). When predation was explicitly considered estimates tended to be higher and more variable (Holsman et al. this volume; Holsman et al. 2015; Livingston and Methot 1998; Hollowed et al. 2000). Clark (1999) found that specifying a conservative (lower) natural mortality rate may be advisable when natural mortality rates are uncertain. More recent studies confirm this (e.g., Johnson et al. 2015).\nIn the supplemental multi-species assessment model alternative values of age and time-varying natural mortality are presented. As in past years the estimates indicate higher values than used here. In the 2018 assessment we evaluated natural mortality, and it was noted that the survey age compositions favored lower values of M while the fishery age composition favored higher values. This is consistent with the patterns seen in the BTS survey data as they show increased abundances of “fully selected” cohorts. Hence, given the model specification (asymptotic selectivity for the BTS age composition data), lower natural mortality rates would be consistent with those data. Given these trade-offs, structural model assumptions were held to be the same as previous years for consistency (i.e., the mortality schedule presented below).\nMaturity-at-age values used for the EBS pollock assessment were originally based on Smith (1981) and were later reevaluated (e.g., Stahl 2004; Stahl and Kruse 2008a; and Ianelli et al. 2005). These studies found inter-annual variability but general consistency with the original schedule of proportion mature at age.\nBased on results from a distinct (apparently) but adjacent stock (Bogoslof assessment, this volume) where fishing has been curtailed since 1992 and spawning surveys have taken place with regularity since then (and included age data) we evaluate as a sensitivity estimated natural mortality for pollock age 3-yrs and older. For the “base” model (model 2020) we continue to use assumed natural mortality-at-age and maturity-at-age (for all models; Smith 1981) as in previous assessments:\n\n\n\nAge determination methods have been validated for pollock (Kimura et al. 1992; Kimura et al. 2006, and Kastelle and Kimura 2006). EBS pollock size-at-age show important differences in growth with differences by area, year, and year class. Pollock in the northwest area are typically smaller at age than pollock in the southeast area. The differences in average weight-at-age are taken into account by stratifying estimates of catch-at-age by year, area, season, and weighting estimates proportional to catch.\nThe assessment model for EBS pollock accounts for numbers of individuals in the population. As noted above, management recommendations are based on allowable catch levels expressed as tons of fish. While estimates of pollock catch-at-age are based on large data sets, the data are only available up until the most recent completed calendar year of fishing (e.g., 2021 for this year). Consequently, estimates of weight-at-age in the current year are required to map total catch biomass (typically equal to the quota) to numbers of fish caught (in the current year). Therefore, if there are errors (or poorly accounted uncertainty) in the current and future mean weight-at-age, this can translate directly into errors between the expected fishing mortality and what mortality occurs. For example, if the mean weight-at-age is biased high, then an ABC (and OFL) value will result in greater numbers of fish being caught (and fishing mortality being higher due to more fish fitting within the ABC).\nAs in previous assessments, we explored patterns in size-at-age and fish condition. Using the NMFS fishery observer data on weight given length we:\n\nextracted all data where non-zero measurements of pollock length and weight were available between the lengths of 35 and 60 cm for the EBS region\ncomputed the mean value of body mass (weight) for each cm length bin over all areas and time\ndivided each weight measurement by that mean cm-specific value (the “standardization” step)\nplotted these standardized values by different areas, years, months etc. to evaluate condition differences (pooling over ages is effective as there were no size-specific biases apparent)\n\nIn the first instance, the overarching seasonal pattern in body mass relative to the mean shows that as the winter progresses prior to peak spawning, pollock are generally skinnier than average whereas in July, the median is about average (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_month}\\)). As the summer/fall progresses, fish were at their heaviest given length (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_month}\\)). This is also apparent when the data are aggregated by A- and B-seasons (and by east and west of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W; referred to as SE and NW respectively) when plotted over time (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_anom_str_yr_box}\\), where stratum 1 = A season, stratum 2 = B season SE, and stratum 3 = B season NW). Combining across seasons, the fishery data shows that recent years were below average weight given length (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_anom_yr_box}\\); note that the anomalies are based on the period 1991-2022).\nExamining the weight-at-age, there are also patterns of variability that vary due to environmental conditions in addition to spatial and temporal patterns of the fishery. Based on the bootstrap distributions and large sample sizes, the within-year sampling variability for pollock is small. However, the between-year variability in mean weights-at-age is relatively high (Table \\(\\ref{tab:wtage}\\)). The coefficients of variation between years are on the order of 6% to 9% (for the ages that are targeted) whereas the sampling variability is generally around 1% or 2%. The approach to account for the identified mean weight-at-age having clear year and cohort effects was continued (e.g., Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_comb}\\)). Details were provided in appendix 1A of Ianelli et al. (2016). The results from this method showed the relative variability between years and cohorts and provide estimates for 2023–2025 (Table \\(\\ref{tab:wtage}\\)). How these fishery weights-at-age estimates can be supplemented using survey weights-at-age is further illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fish_wtage_data_pred}\\).\nIn the 2020 and 2021 fishery, the average weight-at-age for ages 6-8 (the 2012-2014 year classes) was below the time series average. These cohorts have fluctuated around their means in recent years (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_comb}\\)). To examine this more closely, we split the bootstrap results into area-season strata and were able to get an overall picture of the pattern by strata (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_strata}\\) and Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_strata_yr}\\)). This showed that the mean weight-at-age is higher in the the B-season in the area east of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W compared to the A-season and B-season in the area west of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W.\n\n\n\n\nFishing mortality is parameterized to be semi-separable with year and age (selectivity) components. The age component is allowed to vary over time; changes are allowed in each year. The mean value of the age component is constrained to equal one and the last 5 age groups (ages 11–15) are specified to be equal. This latter specification feature is intended to reduce the number of parameters while acknowledging that pollock in this age-range are likely to exhibit similar life-history characteristics (i.e., unlikely to change their relative availability to the fishery with age). The annual components of fishing mortality result in 60 parameters and the age-time selectivity schedule forms a 10x60 matrix of 600 parameters bringing the total fishing mortality parameters to 660. The rationale for including time- varying selectivity has recently been supported as a means to improve retrospective patterns (Szuwalski et al. 2017) and as best practice (Martell and Stewart, 2013).\nFor surveys and indices, the treatment of the catchability coefficient, and interactions with age-specific selectivity require consideration. For the BTS index, selectivity-at-age is estimated with a logistic curve in which year specific deviations in the parameters is allowed. Such time-varying survey selectivity is estimated to account for changes in the availability of pollock to the survey gear and is constrained by pre-specified variance terms. Presently, these variance terms have been set based on balancing input data-based variances and are somewhat subjective. For the AT survey, which originally began in 1979 (the current series including data down to 0.5 m from bottom begins in 1994), optional parameters to allow for age and time-varying patterns exist but for this assessment and other recent assessments, ATS selectivity is constant over time. Overall, four catchability coefficients were estimated: one each for the early fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data (from Low and Ikeda, 1980), the VAST combined bottom trawl survey index, the AT survey data, and the AVO data. An uninformative prior distribution is used for all of the indices. The selectivity parameters for the 2 main indices (BTS and ATS) total 135 (the CPUE and AVO data mirror the fishery and AT survey selectivities, respectively).\nAdditional fishing mortality rates used for recommending harvest levels are estimated conditionally on other outputs from the model. For example, the values corresponding to the \\(F_{40\\%}\\) \\(F_{35\\%}\\) and \\(F_{MSY}\\) harvest rates are found by satisfying the constraint that, given age-specific population parameters (e.g., selectivity, maturity, mortality, weight-at-age), unique values exist that correspond to these fishing mortality rates. The likelihood components that are used to fit the model can be categorized as:\n\nTotal catch biomass (log-normal, \\(\\sigma=0.05\\))\nLog-normal indices of pollock biomass; bottom trawl surveys assume annual estimates of sampling error, as represented in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:bts_biom}\\) along with the covariance matrices (for the density-dependent and VAST index series); for the AT index the annual errors were specified to have a mean CV of 0.20; while for the AVO data, a value relative to the AT index was estimated and scaled to have a mean CV of 0.3).\nFishery and survey proportions-at-age estimates (multinomial with effective sample sizes presented Table \\(\\ref{tab:input_n}\\)).\nAge 1 index from the AT survey (CV set equal to 30% as in prior assessments).\n\nSelectivity constraints: penalties/priors on age-age variability, time changes, and decreasing (with age) patterns.\nStock-recruitment: penalties/priors involved with fitting a stochastic stock-recruitment relationship within the integrated model.\n“Fixed effects” terms accounting for cohort and year sources of variability in fishery mean weights-at-age estimated based on available data from 1991-2022 from the fishery (and 1982-2023 for the bottom-trawl survey data) and externally estimated variance terms as described in Appendix 1A of Ianelli et al. (2016; see Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fish_wtage_data_pred}\\)).\n\nWork evaluating temperature and predation-dependent effects on the stock- recruitment estimates continues (Spencer et al. 2016). This approach modified the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship by including the effect of temperature and predation mortality. A relationship between recruitment residuals and temperature was noted(similar to that found in Mueter et al., 2011 and subsequently noted in Thorson et al., 2020a) and lower pollock recruitment during warmer conditions might be expected. Similar results relating summer temperature conditions to subsequent pollock recruitment for recent years were also found by Yasumiishi et al. (2015) where research suggests that summer warmth is associated with earlier diapause of copepods (Thorson et al., 2020b), such that a fall (but not spring) survey of copepod densities is also associated with cold conditions and elevated recruitment (Eisner et al., 2020).",

The data updated from last year’s analyses include:\n\nThe 2022 fishery age composition data were added\nThe catch biomass estimates were updated through to the current year\nThe 2023 bottom-trawl survey index, weight, and age composition data were revised and added\nThe 2023 acoustic-trawl survey index, weight, and preliminary age composition data were added\nThe AVO backscatter data collected opportunistically from the 2022 bottom trawl survey and post processed into the AVO backscatter index were included.\n\nA simplified version of the assessment (with mainly the same data and likelihood-fitting method) is included as a supplemental multi-species assessment model. As presented since 2016, it allows for trophic interactions among key prey and predator species and for pollock, and it can be used to evaluate age and time-varying natural mortality estimates in addition to alternative catch scenarios and management targets (see this volume: EBS multi-species model).",

    "text": "In the 2019 assessment, the spatio-temporal model fit to BTS CPUE data including stations from the NBS was expanded using the VAST methods detailed in Thorson (2018). This data treatment was included as a model alternative and adopted for ABC/OFL specifications by the SSC in 2020 along with other modifications including a spatio-temporal treatment of the age composition data. This year, we used the same model configuration and simply examined the influence of additional data that became available this year. For projections we added the ability to test alternative Tier scenarios. The current base model is Model 20.0a, which was adopted last year by the SSC, and which differed from the previous base model (Model 16.2) in that it included the 2020 USV acoustic biomass estimate as an extension of the standard AT survey biomass time series and excluded the 1978 year class from the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship. We examined the following alternative models:\nIn an effort to test different stock assessment software, we adopted the pollock data and used some of the model software that was simulation tested in Li et al. (2021). While preliminary, the results were consistent with the bespoke model used here. However, the impact of missing features in the more generalized models tested in this paper requires more investigation. Specifically, the bespoke model used here includes an informed fixed-effects model for projecting weight-at-age and uses a covariance matrix for index time series that is unavailable in the models tested in Li et al. (2021).\n\n\n\nSample sizes for age-composition data were re-evaluated in 2016 against the trade-off with flexibility in time and age varying selectivity. In subsequent assessment years the values have changed significantly from the 4-periods of fishery data from which these weights were applied and calculated. Principally, this work resulted in tuning the recent era (1991-present year) to an average sample sizes of 350 for the fishery and then using estimated values for the period 1978-1990 and as earlier (Table \\(\\ref{tab:input_n}\\)). We assumed average values of 100 and 50 for the BTS and ATS data, respectively with inter-annual variability reflecting the variability in the number of hauls sampled for ages. This year we re-evaluated one-step tuning as a sensitivity following Francis 2011 (equation TA1.8, hereafter referred to as Francis weights).\nRecent work has shown ways to improve estimation schemes that deal with the interaction between flexibility in fishery selectivity and statistical properties of composition data sample size. Specifically, the Dirichlet-multinomial using either Laplace approximation (Thorson et al., 2015) or adnuts (Monnahan and Kristensen, 2018) should be implemented (e.g., as shown by Xu et al., 2020). We hope to evaluate these and alternatives in the coming year.",

    "text": "The baseline model specification has been to use constant natural mortality rates at age (M=0.9, 0.45, and 0.3 for ages 1, 2, and 3+ respectively (Wespestad and Terry 1984). When predation was explicitly considered estimates tended to be higher and more variable (Holsman et al. this volume; Holsman et al. 2015; Livingston and Methot 1998; Hollowed et al. 2000). Clark (1999) found that specifying a conservative (lower) natural mortality rate may be advisable when natural mortality rates are uncertain. More recent studies confirm this (e.g., Johnson et al. 2015).\nIn the supplemental multi-species assessment model alternative values of age and time-varying natural mortality are presented. As in past years the estimates indicate higher values than used here. In the 2018 assessment we evaluated natural mortality, and it was noted that the survey age compositions favored lower values of M while the fishery age composition favored higher values. This is consistent with the patterns seen in the BTS survey data as they show increased abundances of “fully selected” cohorts. Hence, given the model specification (asymptotic selectivity for the BTS age composition data), lower natural mortality rates would be consistent with those data. Given these trade-offs, structural model assumptions were held to be the same as previous years for consistency (i.e., the mortality schedule presented below).\nMaturity-at-age values used for the EBS pollock assessment were originally based on Smith (1981) and were later reevaluated (e.g., Stahl 2004; Stahl and Kruse 2008a; and Ianelli et al. 2005). These studies found inter-annual variability but general consistency with the original schedule of proportion mature at age.\nBased on results from a distinct (apparently) but adjacent stock (Bogoslof assessment, this volume) where fishing has been curtailed since 1992 and spawning surveys have taken place with regularity since then (and included age data) we evaluate as a sensitivity estimated natural mortality for pollock age 3-yrs and older. For the “base” model (model 2020) we continue to use assumed natural mortality-at-age and maturity-at-age (for all models; Smith 1981) as in previous assessments:\n\n\n\nAge determination methods have been validated for pollock (Kimura et al. 1992; Kimura et al. 2006, and Kastelle and Kimura 2006). EBS pollock size-at-age show important differences in growth with differences by area, year, and year class. Pollock in the northwest area are typically smaller at age than pollock in the southeast area. The differences in average weight-at-age are taken into account by stratifying estimates of catch-at-age by year, area, season, and weighting estimates proportional to catch.\nThe assessment model for EBS pollock accounts for numbers of individuals in the population. As noted above, management recommendations are based on allowable catch levels expressed as tons of fish. While estimates of pollock catch-at-age are based on large data sets, the data are only available up until the most recent completed calendar year of fishing (e.g., 2021 for this year). Consequently, estimates of weight-at-age in the current year are required to map total catch biomass (typically equal to the quota) to numbers of fish caught (in the current year). Therefore, if there are errors (or poorly accounted uncertainty) in the current and future mean weight-at-age, this can translate directly into errors between the expected fishing mortality and what mortality occurs. For example, if the mean weight-at-age is biased high, then an ABC (and OFL) value will result in greater numbers of fish being caught (and fishing mortality being higher due to more fish fitting within the ABC).\nAs in previous assessments, we explored patterns in size-at-age and fish condition. Using the NMFS fishery observer data on weight given length we:\n\nextracted all data where non-zero measurements of pollock length and weight were available between the lengths of 35 and 60 cm for the EBS region\ncomputed the mean value of body mass (weight) for each cm length bin over all areas and time\ndivided each weight measurement by that mean cm-specific value (the “standardization” step)\nplotted these standardized values by different areas, years, months etc. to evaluate condition differences (pooling over ages is effective as there were no size-specific biases apparent)\n\nIn the first instance, the overarching seasonal pattern in body mass relative to the mean shows that as the winter progresses prior to peak spawning, pollock are generally skinnier than average whereas in July, the median is about average (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_month}\\)). As the summer/fall progresses, fish were at their heaviest given length (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_month}\\)). This is also apparent when the data are aggregated by A- and B-seasons (and by east and west of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W; referred to as SE and NW respectively) when plotted over time (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_anom_str_yr_box}\\), where stratum 1 = A season, stratum 2 = B season SE, and stratum 3 = B season NW). Combining across seasons, the fishery data shows that recent years were below average weight given length (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_lw_anom_yr_box}\\); note that the anomalies are based on the period 1991-2022).\nExamining the weight-at-age, there are also patterns of variability that vary due to environmental conditions in addition to spatial and temporal patterns of the fishery. Based on the bootstrap distributions and large sample sizes, the within-year sampling variability for pollock is small. However, the between-year variability in mean weights-at-age is relatively high (Table \\(\\ref{tab:wtage}\\)). The coefficients of variation between years are on the order of 6% to 9% (for the ages that are targeted) whereas the sampling variability is generally around 1% or 2%. The approach to account for the identified mean weight-at-age having clear year and cohort effects was continued (e.g., Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_comb}\\)). Details were provided in appendix 1A of Ianelli et al. (2016). The results from this method showed the relative variability between years and cohorts and provide estimates for 2023–2025 (Table \\(\\ref{tab:wtage}\\)). How these fishery weights-at-age estimates can be supplemented using survey weights-at-age is further illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fish_wtage_data_pred}\\).\nIn the 2020 and 2021 fishery, the average weight-at-age for ages 6-8 (the 2012-2014 year classes) was below the time series average. These cohorts have fluctuated around their means in recent years (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_comb}\\)). To examine this more closely, we split the bootstrap results into area-season strata and were able to get an overall picture of the pattern by strata (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_strata}\\) and Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_strata_yr}\\)). This showed that the mean weight-at-age is higher in the the B-season in the area east of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W compared to the A-season and B-season in the area west of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W.",

    "text": "Fishing mortality is parameterized to be semi-separable with year and age (selectivity) components. The age component is allowed to vary over time; changes are allowed in each year. The mean value of the age component is constrained to equal one and the last 5 age groups (ages 11–15) are specified to be equal. This latter specification feature is intended to reduce the number of parameters while acknowledging that pollock in this age-range are likely to exhibit similar life-history characteristics (i.e., unlikely to change their relative availability to the fishery with age). The annual components of fishing mortality result in 60 parameters and the age-time selectivity schedule forms a 10x60 matrix of 600 parameters bringing the total fishing mortality parameters to 660. The rationale for including time- varying selectivity has recently been supported as a means to improve retrospective patterns (Szuwalski et al. 2017) and as best practice (Martell and Stewart, 2013).\nFor surveys and indices, the treatment of the catchability coefficient, and interactions with age-specific selectivity require consideration. For the BTS index, selectivity-at-age is estimated with a logistic curve in which year specific deviations in the parameters is allowed. Such time-varying survey selectivity is estimated to account for changes in the availability of pollock to the survey gear and is constrained by pre-specified variance terms. Presently, these variance terms have been set based on balancing input data-based variances and are somewhat subjective. For the AT survey, which originally began in 1979 (the current series including data down to 0.5 m from bottom begins in 1994), optional parameters to allow for age and time-varying patterns exist but for this assessment and other recent assessments, ATS selectivity is constant over time. Overall, four catchability coefficients were estimated: one each for the early fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data (from Low and Ikeda, 1980), the VAST combined bottom trawl survey index, the AT survey data, and the AVO data. An uninformative prior distribution is used for all of the indices. The selectivity parameters for the 2 main indices (BTS and ATS) total 135 (the CPUE and AVO data mirror the fishery and AT survey selectivities, respectively).\nAdditional fishing mortality rates used for recommending harvest levels are estimated conditionally on other outputs from the model. For example, the values corresponding to the \\(F_{40\\%}\\) \\(F_{35\\%}\\) and \\(F_{MSY}\\) harvest rates are found by satisfying the constraint that, given age-specific population parameters (e.g., selectivity, maturity, mortality, weight-at-age), unique values exist that correspond to these fishing mortality rates. The likelihood components that are used to fit the model can be categorized as:\n\nTotal catch biomass (log-normal, \\(\\sigma=0.05\\))\nLog-normal indices of pollock biomass; bottom trawl surveys assume annual estimates of sampling error, as represented in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:bts_biom}\\) along with the covariance matrices (for the density-dependent and VAST index series); for the AT index the annual errors were specified to have a mean CV of 0.20; while for the AVO data, a value relative to the AT index was estimated and scaled to have a mean CV of 0.3).\nFishery and survey proportions-at-age estimates (multinomial with effective sample sizes presented Table \\(\\ref{tab:input_n}\\)).\nAge 1 index from the AT survey (CV set equal to 30% as in prior assessments).\n\nSelectivity constraints: penalties/priors on age-age variability, time changes, and decreasing (with age) patterns.\nStock-recruitment: penalties/priors involved with fitting a stochastic stock-recruitment relationship within the integrated model.\n“Fixed effects” terms accounting for cohort and year sources of variability in fishery mean weights-at-age estimated based on available data from 1991-2022 from the fishery (and 1982-2023 for the bottom-trawl survey data) and externally estimated variance terms as described in Appendix 1A of Ianelli et al. (2016; see Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fish_wtage_data_pred}\\)).\n\nWork evaluating temperature and predation-dependent effects on the stock- recruitment estimates continues (Spencer et al. 2016). This approach modified the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship by including the effect of temperature and predation mortality. A relationship between recruitment residuals and temperature was noted(similar to that found in Mueter et al., 2011 and subsequently noted in Thorson et al., 2020a) and lower pollock recruitment during warmer conditions might be expected. Similar results relating summer temperature conditions to subsequent pollock recruitment for recent years were also found by Yasumiishi et al. (2015) where research suggests that summer warmth is associated with earlier diapause of copepods (Thorson et al., 2020b), such that a fall (but not spring) survey of copepod densities is also associated with cold conditions and elevated recruitment (Eisner et al., 2020).",

    "text": "Historically, EBS pollock catches were low until directed foreign fisheries began in 1964. Catches increased rapidly during the late 1960s and reached a peak in 1970–75 when they ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 million t annually. Following the peak catch in 1972, bilateral agreements with Japan and the USSR resulted in reductions. During a 10-year period, catches by foreign vessels operating in the “Donut Hole” region of the Aleutian Basin were substantial totaling nearly 7 million t (Table \\(\\ref{tab:catch}\\)). A fishing moratorium for this area was enacted in 1993 and only trace amounts of pollock have been harvested from the Aleutian Basin region since then. Since the late 1970s, the average EBS pollock catch has been about 1.2 million t, ranging from 0.810 million t in 2009 to nearly 1.5 million t during 2002–2006 (Table \\(\\ref{tab:catch}\\)). United States vessels began fishing for pollock in 1980 and by 1988 the fishery became fully domestic. The current observer program for the domestic fishery formally began in 1991 and prior to that, observers were deployed aboard the foreign and joint-venture operations since the late 1970s. From the period 1991 to 2011 about 80% of the catch was observed at sea or during dockside offloading. Since 2011, regulations require that all vessels participating in the pollock fishery carry at least one observer so nearly 100% of the pollock fishing operations are monitored by scientifically trained observers. Historical catch estimates used in the assessment, along with management measures (i.e., OFLs, ABCs and TACs) are shown in Table \\(\\ref{tab:abc_tac}\\).\n\n\nThe “A-season” for directed EBS pollock fishing opens on January 20th and fishing typically extends into early-mid April. During this season the fishery targets pre-spawning pollock and produces pollock roe that, under optimal conditions, can comprise over 4% of the catch in weight. The summer, or “B-season” presently opens on June 10th and fishing extends through noon on November 1st. The A-season fishery concentrates primarily north and west of Unimak Island depending on ice conditions and fish distribution. There has also been effort along the 100m depth contour (and deeper) between Unimak Island and the Pribilof Islands. The general pattern by season (and area) has varied over time with recent B-season catches occurring in the southeast portion of the shelf (east of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W longitude; Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch}\\)). Since 2011, regulations and industry-based measures to reduce Chinook salmon bycatch have affected the spatial distribution of the fishery and to some degree, the way individual vessel operators fish (Stram and Ianelli, 2014). In 2020, the fishing fleet encountered higher than normal bycatch of herring and this has further constrained the fishing grounds due to area closures. Additionally, sablefish appear to be highly abundant in the region and have comprised a significant proportion of the incidental catches in the pollock fishery (proportionally still less than 1% of the total landings). Comparing encounters of bycatch relative to the effort (total duration of all tows) the pollock fleet had a relatively flat trend in the Chinook salmon bycatch while sablefish and herring was down from the relatively high levels last year (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_psc_cpue}\\)).\nThe catch estimates by sex for the seasons indicate that over time, the number of males and females has been fairly equal but in the period 2017-2020 the A-season catch of females has been slightly higher and conversely, in the B-season there has been a slightly higher number of males taken (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_sex}\\)). This figure is updated through 2021 and shows the high numbers of fish taken in that year because they were smaller than average. The 2022 A-season fishery spatial pattern had a higher concentrations of fishing near Unimak and east compared to 2020 and 2021 (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_distn_a}\\)). The amount of fishing near the Pribilof Islands was much lower than commonly observed in 2022. The 2022 A-season nominal catch rates were lower than the 2020 peak (for the fleet in aggregate) (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_cpue}\\)). Beginning in 2017, due to a regulatory change, up to 45% of the TAC could be taken in the A-season (previously only 40% of the TAC could be taken). This conservation measure was made to allow greater flexibility to avoid Chinook salmon in the B-season. The pollock fleet as a whole continues to take advantage of this flexibility (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:prop_a_season}\\)). However, this figure indicates that in 2022, the proportion of catch in February increased over the 2021 pattern and this was consistent in subsequent months as well. This suggests that fishing conditions were improved. Pollock roe is an important product coming from the winter fishery. The amount produced in the 2022 A-season was the lowest since 2013 and continued the big drop from the previous year (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:roe}\\)).\nThe summer-fall fishing conditions for 2022 improved considerably over 2021 and was about average on nominal catch rates (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_cpue}\\)). The number of hours the fleet required to catch the same tonnage of pollock was also improved relative to 2020. In the B-season catches in the northwestern area dropped relative to the previous two years (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_distn_b}\\)). In addition, we present an approach first shown in 2019 to evaluate how concentrated the fleet was on average. We called this a measure of fleet dispersion: the relative distance or spread of the fishery in space. Briefly, the calculation computes for a given day, the distance between all trawl tows (within and across boats). These distances are then averaged for year and season. Updated to this year, results indicated that in both seasons the fleet was less dispersed than last year suggesting that fishing was fairly concentrated without a need to fish in more places (Fig \\(\\ref{fig:fleet_dispersal}\\)).\nWe continued to investigate the tow specific mean weight of fish. These provide a direct mean somatic mass (pollock body weight) for pollock within a tow. The data arise from the sampled total weight (e.g., of several baskets of pollock) divided by the enumerated number of fish in that sample. Such records exist for each tow. Summing these by extrapolated weight of the pollock catch within that tow, and binning by weight increments (here by 50 gram intervals), allows us to obtain some additional fine-scale information on the size trends in the pollock fishery. The annual patterns of these data show that overall, the B-season of 2020 was different with the small mode of fish persisting into the 2021 B-season (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wt_freq}\\)). Compiling the data by week we show that the fish size was consistent the growth of the 2018 year class during this B-season (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wt_freq_week}\\)).\nThe catch of EBS pollock has averaged 1.26 million t in the period since 1979. The lowest catches occurred in 2009 and 2010 when the limits were set to 0.81 million t due to stock declines (Table \\(\\ref{tab:abc_tac}\\)). The recent 5-year average (2018-2022) catch has been 1.326 million t. Pollock catches that are retained or discarded (based on NMFS observer estimates) in the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for 1991–r thisyr are shown in Table \\(\\ref{tab:catch_disc}\\). Since 1991, estimates of discarded pollock have ranged from a high of 9.6% of total pollock catch in 1991 to recent lows of around 0.6% to 1.1%. These low values reflect the implementation of the NMFS’ Improved Retention /Improved Utilization program. Prior to the implementation of the American Fisheries Act (AFA) in 1999, higher discards may have occurred under the “race for fish” and pollock marketable sizes were caught incidentally. Since implementation of the AFA, the vessel operators have more time to pursue optimal sizes of pollock for market since the quota is allocated to vessels (via cooperative arrangements). In addition, several vessels have made gear modifications to avoid retention of smaller pollock. In all cases, the magnitude of discards counts as part of the total catch for management (to ensure the TAC is not exceeded) and within the assessment. Bycatch of other non-target, target, and prohibited species is presented in the section titled Ecosystem Considerations below. In that section it is noted that the bycatch of pollock in other target fisheries is more than double the bycatch of other target species (e.g., Pacific cod) in the pollock fishery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EBS pollock stock is managed by NMFS regulations that provide limits on seasonal catch. The NMFS observer program data provide near real-time statistics during the season and vessels operate within well-defined limits. In most years, the TACs have been set well below the ABC value and catches have stayed within these constraints (Table \\(\\ref{tab:abc_tac}\\)). Allocations of the TAC split first with 10% to western Alaska communities as part of the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program and the remainder between at-sea processors and shore-based sectors. For a characterization of the CDQ program see Haynie (2014). Seung and Ianelli (2016) combined a fish population dynamics model with an economic model to evaluate regional impacts.\nDue to concerns that groundfish fisheries may impact the rebuilding of the Steller sea lion population, a number of management measures have been implemented over the years. Some measures were designed to reduce the possibility of competitive interactions between fisheries and Steller sea lions. For the pollock fisheries, seasonal fishery catch and pollock biomass distributions (from surveys) indicated that the apparent disproportionately high seasonal harvest rates within Steller sea lion critical habitat could lead to reduced sea lion prey densities. Consequently, management measures redistributed the fishery both temporally and spatially according to pollock biomass distributions. This was intended to disperse fishing so that localized harvest rates were more consistent with estimated annual exploitation rates. The measures include establishing: 1) pollock fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookery or haulout sites; 2) phased-in reductions in the seasonal proportions of TAC that can be taken from critical habitat; and 3) additional seasonal TAC releases to disperse the fishery in time.\nPrior to adoption of the above management measures, the pollock fishery occurred throughout each of the three major NMFS management regions of the North Pacific Ocean: the Aleutian Islands (1,001,780 km\\(^2\\) inside the EEZ), the Eastern Bering Sea (968,600 km\\(^2\\)), and the Gulf of Alaska (1,156,100 km\\(^2\\)). The marine portion of Steller sea lion critical habitat in Alaska west of 150\\(^{\\circ}\\)W encompasses 386,770 km\\(^2\\) of ocean surface, or 12% of the fishery management regions.\nFrom 1995–1999 84,100 km\\(^2\\), or 22% of the Steller sea lion critical habitat was closed to the pollock fishery. Most of this closure consisted of the 10 and 20 nm radius all-trawl fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookeries (48,920 km\\(^2\\), or 13% of critical habitat). The remainder was largely management area 518 (35,180 km\\(^2\\), or 9% of critical habitat) that was closed pursuant to an international agreement to protect spawning stocks of central Bering Sea pollock. In 1999, an additional 83,080 km\\(^2\\) (21%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian Islands was closed to pollock fishing along with 43,170 km\\(^2\\) (11%) around sea lion haulouts in the GOA and Eastern Bering Sea. In 1998, over 22,000 t of pollock were caught in the Aleutian Island region, with over 17,000 t taken within critical habitat region. Between 1999 and 2004 a directed fishery for pollock was prohibited in this region. Subsequently, 210,350 km\\(^2\\) (54%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian Islands was closed to the pollock fishery. In 2000 the remaining phased-in reductions in the proportions of seasonal TAC that could be caught within the BSAI Steller sea lion Conservation Area (SCA) were implemented.\nOn the EBS shelf, an estimate (based on observer at-sea data) of the proportion of pollock caught in the SCA has averaged about 44% annually. During the A-season, the average is also about 44%. Nonetheless, the proportion of pollock caught within the SCA varies considerably, presumably due to temperature regimes and the relative population age structure. The annual proportion of catch has ranged from an annual low of 11% in 2010 to high of 60% in 1998–the 2019 annual value was 58% and quite high again in the A-season (68%; Ianelli et al. 2020). The higher values in recent years were likely due to good fishing conditions close to the main port. The recent transition from at-sea observer sampling of many catcher vessels to a combination of at-sea electronic monitoring and shore-based observer sampling has resulted in a temporary hiatus in to associate catches with specific areas. Work has progressed to link the position information to offloads so that haul records could be used to evaluate fishing patterns.\nThe AFA reduced the capacity of the catcher/processor fleet and permitted the formation of cooperatives in each industry sector by the year 2000. Because of some of its provisions, the AFA gave the industry the ability to respond efficiently to changes mandated for sea lion conservation and salmon bycatch measures. Without such a catch-share program, these additional measures would likely have been less effective and less economical (Strong and Criddle 2014).\nAn additional strategy to minimize potential adverse effects on sea lion populations is to disperse the fishery throughout more of the pollock range on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf. While the distribution of fishing during the A-season is limited due to ice and weather conditions, there appears to be some dispersion to the northwest area (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_distn_a}\\)).\nThe majority (about 56%) of Chinook salmon caught as bycatch in the pollock fishery originate from western Alaskan rivers. This was updated at the June 2022 Council meeting and is activities are monitored and reported closely at the Council (at this website. In summary, Chinook salmon bycatch management measures went into effect in 2011 which imposed revised prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. These limits, when reached, close the fishery by sector and season (Amendment 91 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) resulting from the NPFMC’s 2009 action). Previously, all measures for salmon bycatch imposed seasonal area closures when PSC levels reached the limit (fishing could continue outside of the closed areas). The current program imposes a dual cap system by fishing sector and season. A goal of this system was to maintain incentives to avoid bycatch at a broad range of relative salmon abundance (and encounter rates). Participants are also required to take part in an incentive program agreement (IPA). These IPAs are approved and reviewed annually by NMFS to ensure individual vessel accountability. The fishery has been operating under rules to implement this program since January 2011.\nFurther measures to reduce salmon bycatch in the pollock fishery were developed and the Council took action on Amendment 110 to the BSAI Groundfish FMP in April 2015. These additional measures were designed to add protection for Chinook salmon by imposing more restrictive PSC limits in times of low western Alaskan Chinook salmon abundance. This included provisions within the IPAs that reduce fishing in months of higher bycatch encounters and mandate the use of salmon excluders in trawl nets. These provisions were also included to provide more flexible management measures for chum salmon bycatch within the IPAs rather than through regulatory provisions implemented by Amendment 84 to the FMP. The new measure also included additional seasonal flexibility in pollock fishing so that more pollock (proportionally) could be caught during seasons when salmon bycatch rates were low. Specifically, an additional 5% of the pollock can be caught in the A-season (effectively changing the seasonal allocation from 40% to 45% (as noted above in the discussion assosciated with Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:prop_a_season}\\)). These measures are all part of Amendment 110 and a summary of this and other key management measures is provided in Table \\(\\ref{tab:mgt}\\).\nThere are three time/area closures in regulation to minimize herring PSC impacts: Summer Herring Savings Area 1 an area south of 57\\(^\\circ\\)N latitude and between 162\\(^\\circ\\)W and 164\\(^\\circ\\)W longitude from June 15 through July 1st.

    "text": "Historically, EBS pollock catches were low until directed foreign fisheries began in 1964. Catches increased rapidly during the late 1960s and reached a peak in 1970–75 when they ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 million t annually. Following the peak catch in 1972, bilateral agreements with Japan and the USSR resulted in reductions. During a 10-year period, catches by foreign vessels operating in the “Donut Hole” region of the Aleutian Basin were substantial totaling nearly 7 million t (Table \\(\\ref{tab:catch}\\)). A fishing moratorium for this area was enacted in 1993 and only trace amounts of pollock have been harvested from the Aleutian Basin region since then. Since the late 1970s, the average EBS pollock catch has been about 1.2 million t, ranging from 0.810 million t in 2009 to nearly 1.5 million t during 2002–2006 (Table \\(\\ref{tab:catch}\\)). United States vessels began fishing for pollock in 1980 and by 1988 the fishery became fully domestic. The current observer program for the domestic fishery formally began in 1991 and prior to that, observers were deployed aboard the foreign and joint-venture operations since the late 1970s. From the period 1991 to 2011 about 80% of the catch was observed at sea or during dockside offloading. Since 2011, regulations require that all vessels participating in the pollock fishery carry at least one observer so nearly 100% of the pollock fishing operations are monitored by scientifically trained observers. Historical catch estimates used in the assessment, along with management measures (i.e., OFLs, ABCs and TACs) are shown in Table \\(\\ref{tab:abc_tac}\\).\n\n\nThe “A-season” for directed EBS pollock fishing opens on January 20th and fishing typically extends into early-mid April. During this season the fishery targets pre-spawning pollock and produces pollock roe that, under optimal conditions, can comprise over 4% of the catch in weight. The summer, or “B-season” presently opens on June 10th and fishing extends through noon on November 1st. The A-season fishery concentrates primarily north and west of Unimak Island depending on ice conditions and fish distribution. There has also been effort along the 100m depth contour (and deeper) between Unimak Island and the Pribilof Islands. The general pattern by season (and area) has varied over time with recent B-season catches occurring in the southeast portion of the shelf (east of 170\\(^\\circ\\)W longitude; Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch}\\)). Since 2011, regulations and industry-based measures to reduce Chinook salmon bycatch have affected the spatial distribution of the fishery and to some degree, the way individual vessel operators fish (Stram and Ianelli, 2014). In 2020, the fishing fleet encountered higher than normal bycatch of herring and this has further constrained the fishing grounds due to area closures. Additionally, sablefish appear to be highly abundant in the region and have comprised a significant proportion of the incidental catches in the pollock fishery (proportionally still less than 1% of the total landings). Comparing encounters of bycatch relative to the effort (total duration of all tows) the pollock fleet had a relatively flat trend in the Chinook salmon bycatch while sablefish and herring was down from the relatively high levels last year (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_psc_cpue}\\)).\nThe catch estimates by sex for the seasons indicate that over time, the number of males and females has been fairly equal but in the period 2017-2020 the A-season catch of females has been slightly higher and conversely, in the B-season there has been a slightly higher number of males taken (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_sex}\\)). This figure is updated through 2021 and shows the high numbers of fish taken in that year because they were smaller than average. The 2022 A-season fishery spatial pattern had a higher concentrations of fishing near Unimak and east compared to 2020 and 2021 (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_distn_a}\\)). The amount of fishing near the Pribilof Islands was much lower than commonly observed in 2022. The 2022 A-season nominal catch rates were lower than the 2020 peak (for the fleet in aggregate) (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_cpue}\\)). Beginning in 2017, due to a regulatory change, up to 45% of the TAC could be taken in the A-season (previously only 40% of the TAC could be taken). This conservation measure was made to allow greater flexibility to avoid Chinook salmon in the B-season. The pollock fleet as a whole continues to take advantage of this flexibility (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:prop_a_season}\\)). However, this figure indicates that in 2022, the proportion of catch in February increased over the 2021 pattern and this was consistent in subsequent months as well. This suggests that fishing conditions were improved. Pollock roe is an important product coming from the winter fishery. The amount produced in the 2022 A-season was the lowest since 2013 and continued the big drop from the previous year (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:roe}\\)).\nThe summer-fall fishing conditions for 2022 improved considerably over 2021 and was about average on nominal catch rates (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_cpue}\\)). The number of hours the fleet required to catch the same tonnage of pollock was also improved relative to 2020. In the B-season catches in the northwestern area dropped relative to the previous two years (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_distn_b}\\)). In addition, we present an approach first shown in 2019 to evaluate how concentrated the fleet was on average. We called this a measure of fleet dispersion: the relative distance or spread of the fishery in space. Briefly, the calculation computes for a given day, the distance between all trawl tows (within and across boats). These distances are then averaged for year and season. Updated to this year, results indicated that in both seasons the fleet was less dispersed than last year suggesting that fishing was fairly concentrated without a need to fish in more places (Fig \\(\\ref{fig:fleet_dispersal}\\)).\nWe continued to investigate the tow specific mean weight of fish. These provide a direct mean somatic mass (pollock body weight) for pollock within a tow. The data arise from the sampled total weight (e.g., of several baskets of pollock) divided by the enumerated number of fish in that sample. Such records exist for each tow. Summing these by extrapolated weight of the pollock catch within that tow, and binning by weight increments (here by 50 gram intervals), allows us to obtain some additional fine-scale information on the size trends in the pollock fishery. The annual patterns of these data show that overall, the B-season of 2020 was different with the small mode of fish persisting into the 2021 B-season (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wt_freq}\\)). Compiling the data by week we show that the fish size was consistent the growth of the 2018 year class during this B-season (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:fsh_wt_freq_week}\\)).\nThe catch of EBS pollock has averaged 1.26 million t in the period since 1979. The lowest catches occurred in 2009 and 2010 when the limits were set to 0.81 million t due to stock declines (Table \\(\\ref{tab:abc_tac}\\)). The recent 5-year average (2018-2022) catch has been 1.326 million t. Pollock catches that are retained or discarded (based on NMFS observer estimates) in the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for 1991–r thisyr are shown in Table \\(\\ref{tab:catch_disc}\\). Since 1991, estimates of discarded pollock have ranged from a high of 9.6% of total pollock catch in 1991 to recent lows of around 0.6% to 1.1%. These low values reflect the implementation of the NMFS’ Improved Retention /Improved Utilization program. Prior to the implementation of the American Fisheries Act (AFA) in 1999, higher discards may have occurred under the “race for fish” and pollock marketable sizes were caught incidentally. Since implementation of the AFA, the vessel operators have more time to pursue optimal sizes of pollock for market since the quota is allocated to vessels (via cooperative arrangements). In addition, several vessels have made gear modifications to avoid retention of smaller pollock. In all cases, the magnitude of discards counts as part of the total catch for management (to ensure the TAC is not exceeded) and within the assessment. Bycatch of other non-target, target, and prohibited species is presented in the section titled Ecosystem Considerations below. In that section it is noted that the bycatch of pollock in other target fisheries is more than double the bycatch of other target species (e.g., Pacific cod) in the pollock fishery.",

    "text": "The EBS pollock stock is managed by NMFS regulations that provide limits on seasonal catch. The NMFS observer program data provide near real-time statistics during the season and vessels operate within well-defined limits. In most years, the TACs have been set well below the ABC value and catches have stayed within these constraints (Table \\(\\ref{tab:abc_tac}\\)). Allocations of the TAC split first with 10% to western Alaska communities as part of the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program and the remainder between at-sea processors and shore-based sectors. For a characterization of the CDQ program see Haynie (2014). Seung and Ianelli (2016) combined a fish population dynamics model with an economic model to evaluate regional impacts.\nDue to concerns that groundfish fisheries may impact the rebuilding of the Steller sea lion population, a number of management measures have been implemented over the years. Some measures were designed to reduce the possibility of competitive interactions between fisheries and Steller sea lions. For the pollock fisheries, seasonal fishery catch and pollock biomass distributions (from surveys) indicated that the apparent disproportionately high seasonal harvest rates within Steller sea lion critical habitat could lead to reduced sea lion prey densities. Consequently, management measures redistributed the fishery both temporally and spatially according to pollock biomass distributions. This was intended to disperse fishing so that localized harvest rates were more consistent with estimated annual exploitation rates. The measures include establishing: 1) pollock fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookery or haulout sites; 2) phased-in reductions in the seasonal proportions of TAC that can be taken from critical habitat; and 3) additional seasonal TAC releases to disperse the fishery in time.\nPrior to adoption of the above management measures, the pollock fishery occurred throughout each of the three major NMFS management regions of the North Pacific Ocean: the Aleutian Islands (1,001,780 km\\(^2\\) inside the EEZ), the Eastern Bering Sea (968,600 km\\(^2\\)), and the Gulf of Alaska (1,156,100 km\\(^2\\)). The marine portion of Steller sea lion critical habitat in Alaska west of 150\\(^{\\circ}\\)W encompasses 386,770 km\\(^2\\) of ocean surface, or 12% of the fishery management regions.\nFrom 1995–1999 84,100 km\\(^2\\), or 22% of the Steller sea lion critical habitat was closed to the pollock fishery. Most of this closure consisted of the 10 and 20 nm radius all-trawl fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookeries (48,920 km\\(^2\\), or 13% of critical habitat). The remainder was largely management area 518 (35,180 km\\(^2\\), or 9% of critical habitat) that was closed pursuant to an international agreement to protect spawning stocks of central Bering Sea pollock. In 1999, an additional 83,080 km\\(^2\\) (21%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian Islands was closed to pollock fishing along with 43,170 km\\(^2\\) (11%) around sea lion haulouts in the GOA and Eastern Bering Sea. In 1998, over 22,000 t of pollock were caught in the Aleutian Island region, with over 17,000 t taken within critical habitat region. Between 1999 and 2004 a directed fishery for pollock was prohibited in this region. Subsequently, 210,350 km\\(^2\\) (54%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian Islands was closed to the pollock fishery. In 2000 the remaining phased-in reductions in the proportions of seasonal TAC that could be caught within the BSAI Steller sea lion Conservation Area (SCA) were implemented.\nOn the EBS shelf, an estimate (based on observer at-sea data) of the proportion of pollock caught in the SCA has averaged about 44% annually. During the A-season, the average is also about 44%. Nonetheless, the proportion of pollock caught within the SCA varies considerably, presumably due to temperature regimes and the relative population age structure. The annual proportion of catch has ranged from an annual low of 11% in 2010 to high of 60% in 1998–the 2019 annual value was 58% and quite high again in the A-season (68%; Ianelli et al. 2020). The higher values in recent years were likely due to good fishing conditions close to the main port. The recent transition from at-sea observer sampling of many catcher vessels to a combination of at-sea electronic monitoring and shore-based observer sampling has resulted in a temporary hiatus in to associate catches with specific areas. Work has progressed to link the position information to offloads so that haul records could be used to evaluate fishing patterns.\nThe AFA reduced the capacity of the catcher/processor fleet and permitted the formation of cooperatives in each industry sector by the year 2000. Because of some of its provisions, the AFA gave the industry the ability to respond efficiently to changes mandated for sea lion conservation and salmon bycatch measures. Without such a catch-share program, these additional measures would likely have been less effective and less economical (Strong and Criddle 2014).\nAn additional strategy to minimize potential adverse effects on sea lion populations is to disperse the fishery throughout more of the pollock range on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf. While the distribution of fishing during the A-season is limited due to ice and weather conditions, there appears to be some dispersion to the northwest area (Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:catch_distn_a}\\)).\nThe majority (about 56%) of Chinook salmon caught as bycatch in the pollock fishery originate from western Alaskan rivers. This was updated at the June 2022 Council meeting and is activities are monitored and reported closely at the Council (at this website. In summary, Chinook salmon bycatch management measures went into effect in 2011 which imposed revised prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. These limits, when reached, close the fishery by sector and season (Amendment 91 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) resulting from the NPFMC’s 2009 action). Previously, all measures for salmon bycatch imposed seasonal area closures when PSC levels reached the limit (fishing could continue outside of the closed areas). The current program imposes a dual cap system by fishing sector and season. A goal of this system was to maintain incentives to avoid bycatch at a broad range of relative salmon abundance (and encounter rates). Participants are also required to take part in an incentive program agreement (IPA). These IPAs are approved and reviewed annually by NMFS to ensure individual vessel accountability. The fishery has been operating under rules to implement this program since January 2011.\nFurther measures to reduce salmon bycatch in the pollock fishery were developed and the Council took action on Amendment 110 to the BSAI Groundfish FMP in April 2015. These additional measures were designed to add protection for Chinook salmon by imposing more restrictive PSC limits in times of low western Alaskan Chinook salmon abundance.

Specifically, an additional 5% of the pollock can be caught in the A-season (effectively changing the seasonal allocation from 40% to 45% (as noted above in the discussion assosciated with Fig. \\(\\ref{fig:prop_a_season}\\)).

The catch in numbers at age in year \\(t (C_{t,a})\\) and total catch biomass \\((Y_t)\\) can be described as:s\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    C_{t,a}     &= \\frac{F_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}} \\left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}}\\right) N_{t,a}, &1 \\le t \\le T, 1 \\le a \\le A \\\\\n    N_{t+1,a+1} &= N_{t,a-1} e^{-Z_{t,a-1}}                                       &1 \\le t \\le T, 1 \\le a &lt; A   \\\\\n    N_{t+1,A}   &= N_{t,A-1} e^{-Z_{t,A-1}} + N_{t,A} e^{-Z_{t,A}} ,              &1 \\le t \\le T                \\\\\n    Z_{t,a}     &= F_{t,a} + M_{t,a}                                                                            \\\\\n    C_{t,.}     &= \\sum_{a=1}^A{C_{t,a}}                                                                        \\\\\n    p_{t,a}     &= \\frac{C_{t,a} } {C_{t,.} }                                                                   \\\\\n    Y_{t}       &= \\sum_{a=1}^A{w_{t,a}C_{t,a}}                                                                 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere\nFishing mortality (\\(F_{t,a}\\)) is specified as being semi-separable and non-parametric in form with restrictions on the variability following Butterworth, Ianelli, and Hilborn (2003) :\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    F_{t,a}     &= s_{t,a} \\, \\mu^f e^{\\epsilon_t}, &\\epsilon_t   \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_E^{2}) \\\\\n    s_{t+1,a}   &= s_{t,a} \\,       e^{\\gamma_t},   &\\gamma_t     \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_s^{2})\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(s_{t,a}\\) is the selectivity for age class \\(a\\) in year \\(t\\), and \\(\\mu^f\\) is the median fishing mortality rate over time.\nIf the selectivities (\\(s_{t,a}\\)) are constant over time then fishing mortality rate decomposes into an age component and a year component. A curvature penalty on the selectivity coefficients using the squared second-differences to provide smoothness between ages.\nBottom-trawl survey selectivity was set to be asymptotic yet retain the properties desired for the characteristics of this gear. Namely, that the function should allow flexibility in selecting age 1 pollock over time. The functional form of this selectivity was:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    s_{t,a}     &= \\left[ 1+e^{-\\alpha_ta-\\beta_t} \\right]^{-1} , & a&gt;1 \\\\\n    s_{t,a}     &= \\mu_se^{-\\delta^\\mu_t},                        & a=1 \\\\\n    \\alpha_{t}  &= \\bar \\alpha e^{\\delta^\\alpha_t},                     \\\\\n    \\beta_{t}  &= \\bar \\beta e^{\\delta^\\beta_t},                        \n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere the parameters of the selectivity function follow a random walk process as in Dorn et al. (2000):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    \\delta_t^\\mu  -  \\delta_{t+1}^\\mu     &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{\\delta^\\mu}^{2}) \\\\\n    \\\\\n    \\alpha_t^\\mu  -  \\alpha_{t+1}^\\mu     &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{\\alpha^\\mu}^{2}) \\\\\n    \\beta_t^\\mu  -  \\beta_{t+1}^\\mu     &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{\\beta^\\mu}^{2})\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe parameters to be estimated in this part of the model are thus for t=1982 through to r thisyr. The variance terms for these process error parameters were specified to be 0.04.\nIn this assessment, the random-walk deviation penalty was optionally shifted to the changes in log-selectivity. that is, for the BTS estimates, the process error was applied to the logistic parameters as above, but the lognormal penalty was applied to the resulting selectivities-at-age directly. The extent of this variability was evaluated in the context of the impact on age-specific survey catchability/availability and contrasted with an independent estimate of pollock availability to the bottom trawl survey. \\[\\begin{align}\n    {ln(s_{t,a})}  -  {ln(s_{t+1,a})}  &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{sel}^{2}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\\] In 2008 the AT survey selectivity approach was modified. As an option, the age one pollock observed in this trawl can be treated as an index and are not considered part of the age composition (which then ranges from age 2-15). This was done to improve some interaction with the flexible selectivity smoother that is used for this gear and was compared. Additionally, the annual specification of input observation variance terms was allowed for the AT data.\nA diagnostic approach to evaluate input variance specifications (via sample size under multinomial assumptions) was added in the 2018 assessment. This method uses residuals from mean ages together with the concept that the sample variance of mean age (from a given annual data set) varies inversely with input sample size. It can be shown that for a given set of input proportions at age (up to the maximum age \\(A\\)) and sample size \\(N_t\\) for year \\(t\\), an adjustment factor \\(\\nu\\) for input sample size can be computed when compared with the assessment model predicted proportions at age (\\(\\hat p_{ta}\\)) and model predicted mean age (\\(\\hat{\\bar{a_t}}\\)): \\[\\begin{align}\n\\nu   &= \\text{var}\\left( r^a_t \\sqrt{\\frac{N_t}{\\kappa_t} }\\right)^{-1} \\\\\nr^a_t &= \\bar a_t - \\hat{\\bar{a_t}}                                      \\\\\n\\kappa_t &= \\left[ \\sum_a^A {\\bar a_t - \\hat{\\bar{a_t}}} \\right]^{0.5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(r^a_t\\) is the residual of mean age and \\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\bar{a_t}} &= \\sum_a^A{a \\hat p_{ta}}\\, \\\\\n{\\bar a_t}      &= \\sum_a^A{a p_{ta}}\\,\n\\end{align}\\]\nBased on previous analyses, we used the above relationship as a diagnostic for evaluating input sample sizes by comparing model predicted mean ages with observed mean ages and the implied 95% confidence bands. This method provided support for modifying the frequency of allowing selectivity changes.\n\n\n\nIn these analyses, recruitment (\\(R_t\\)) represents numbers of age-1 individuals modeled as a stochastic function of spawning stock biomass. \\[\\begin{align}\n        R_t = f\\left(B_{t-1} \\right)\n\\end{align}\\] with mature spawning biomass during year \\(t\\) was defined as: \\[\\begin{align}\n  B_t = \\sum_{a=1}^A{ w_{t,a}\\phi_aN_{t,a}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nand, \\(\\phi_a\\) is the proportion of mature females at age is as shown in the sub-section titled Natural mortality and maturity at age under “Parameters estimated independently” above.\nA reparameterized form for the stock-recruitment relationship following Francis (1992) was used. For the optional Beverton-Holt form (the Ricker form presented in Eq. 12 was adopted for this assessment) we have:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR_t &= \\frac{B_{t-1}e^{\\varepsilon_t} }{\\alpha+\\beta B_{t-1} }\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere\nValues for the stock-recruitment function parameters and are calculated from the values of (the number of 0-year-olds in the absence of exploitation and recruitment variability) and the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship (\\(h\\)). The steepness is the fraction of R0 to be expected (in the absence of recruitment variability) when the mature biomass is reduced to 20% of its pristine level Francis (1992) , so that:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &= \\tilde B_0 \\frac{1-h}{4h} \\\\\n\\beta &= \\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0 }\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde B_0\\) is the total egg production (or proxy, e.g., female spawning biomass) in the absence of exploitation (and recruitment variability) expressed as a fraction of \\(R_0\\).\nSome interpretation and further explanation follows. For steepness equal 0.2, then recruits are a linear function of spawning biomass (implying no surplus production). For steepness equal to 1.0, then recruitment is constant for all levels of spawning stock size. A value of \\(h = 0.9\\) implies that at 20% of the unfished spawning stock size will result in an expected value of 90% unfished recruitment level. Steepness of 0.7 is a commonly assumed default value for the Beverton-Holt form (e.g., Kimura (1989)). The prior distribution for steepness used a beta distribution as in Ianelli et al. (2016). The prior on steepness was specified to be a symmetric form of the Beta distribution with \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 14.93\\) implying a prior mean of 0.5 and CV of 12% (implying that there is about a 14% chance that the steepness is greater than 0.6). This conservative prior is consistent with previous years’ application and serves to constrain the stock-recruitment curve from favoring steep slopes (uninformative priors result in \\(F_{MSY}\\) values near an \\(F_{SPR}\\) of about \\(F_{18\\%}\\) a value considerably higher than the default proxy of \\(F_{35\\%}\\)). The residual pattern for the post-1977 recruits used in fitting the curve with a more diffuse prior resulted in all estimated recruits being below the curve for stock sizes less than \\(B_{MSY}\\) (except for the 1978 year class). We believe this to be driven primarily by the apparent negative-slope for recruits relative to stock sizes above \\(B_{MSY}\\) and as such, provides a potentially unrealistic estimate of productivity at low stock sizes. This prior was elicited from the rationale that residuals should be reasonably balanced throughout the range of spawning stock sizes. Whereas this is somewhat circular (i.e., using data for prior elicitation), the point here is that residual patterns (typically ignored in these types of models) were qualitatively considered.\nIn model 16.1 (from the 2019 assessment), a Beverton Holt stock recruitment form was implemented using the prior value of 0.67 for steepness and a CV of 0.17. This resulted in beta distribution parameters (for the prior) at \\(\\alpha = 6.339\\) and\n\\(\\beta = 4.293\\).\nThe value of \\(\\sigma_R\\) was set at 1.0 to accommodate additional uncertainty in factors affecting recruitment variability.\nTo have the critical value for the stock-recruitment function (steepness, h) on the same scale for the Ricker model, we begin with the parameterization of Kimura (1989) : \\[\\begin{align}\nR_t &= \\frac{B_{t-1}e^{\\alpha \\left(1-B_{t-1} \\frac{R_0}{\\psi_0} \\right)}}{\\psi_0}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIt can be shown that the Ricker parameter a maps to steepness as: \\[\\begin{align}\nh &= \\frac{e^\\alpha}{e^\\alpha+4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nso that the prior used on h can be implemented in both the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment forms. Here the term \\(\\psi_0\\) represents the equilibrium unfished spawning biomass per-recruit.\n\n\n\nIn 2006 a replay feature was added where the time series of recruitment estimates from a particular model is used to compute the subsequent abundance expectation had no fishing occurred. These recruitments are adjusted from the original estimates by the ratio of the expected recruitment given spawning biomass (with and without fishing) and the estimated stock-recruitment curve. I.e., the recruitment under no fishing is modified as: \\[R_t' = \\hat{R}_t\\frac{f(B_{t-1}')}{f(B_{t-1})}\\] where \\(R_t\\) is the original recruitment estimate in year \\(t\\) with \\(B_{t-1}'\\) and \\(B_{t-1}\\) representing the stock-recruitment function given spawning biomass under no fishing and under the estimated fishing intensity, respectively.\nThe assessment model code allows retrospective analyses (e.g., Parma (1993), and J. N. Ianelli and Fournier (1998)). This was designed to assist in specifying how spawning biomass patterns (and uncertainty) have changed due to new data. The retrospective approach simply uses the current model to evaluate how it may change over time with the addition of new data based on the evolution of data collected over the past several years.\nTo provide a diagnostic for diversity in the age structure of the spawning biomass, we computed the Shannon entropy in exponential form. Following Jost (2006), and substituting the population’s mature age structure in place of species, this provides an estimate of the effective number of ages. This is computed for each year as a measure of different age groups contributing to the spawning population as:\n\\[ H_i = \\exp(-\\sum p_a \\cdot \\log(p_a)) \\]\nwhere \\(p_a\\) is the proportion of mature fish biomass-at-age \\(a\\) in year \\(i\\).\n\n\n\nThe objective function was simply the sum of the negative log-likelihood function and logs of the prior distributions. To fit large numbers of parameters in nonlinear models it is useful to be able to estimate certain parameters in different stages. The ability to estimate stages is also important in using robust likelihood functions since it is often undesirable to use robust objective functions when models are far from a solution. Consequently, in the early stages of estimation we use the following log- likelihood function for the survey and fishery catch at age data (in numbers):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) &= n \\sum_{t,a}{ p_{ta} \\ln \\hat p_{ta} } \\\\\np_{ta} &= \\frac{O_{ta}}{\\sum_a{O_{ta}}} \\hspace{20pt}\n\\hat p_{ta} = \\frac{\\hat C_{ta}}{\\sum_a{\\hat C_{ta}}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{C} &= \\mathbf{CE}  \\\\\n\\mathbf{E}  &=  \\begin{array}{llll}\nb_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & \\dots & b_{1,15} \\\\\nb_{2,1} & b_{2,2} &       & b_{2,15} \\\\\n\\vdots &         & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\nb_{15,1} & b_{15,2} & \\dots      & b_{15,15}\n\\end{array}  \n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(A\\), and \\(T\\), represent the number of age classes and years, respectively, n is the sample size, and represent the observed and predicted numbers at age in the catch. The elements bi,j represent ageing mis-classification proportions are based on independent agreement rates between otolith age readers. For the models presented this year, the option for including aging errors was re-evaluated.\nSample size values were revised and are shown in the main document. Strictly speaking, the amount of data collected for this fishery indicates higher values might be warranted. However, the standard multinomial sampling process is not robust to violations of assumptions (D. A. Fournier et al. (1990)). Consequently, as the model fit approached a solution, we invoke a robust likelihood function which fit proportions at age as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\prod_{a=1}^A\\prod_{t=1}^T \\left[\\left( \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{\\left(p_{ta}-\\hat p_{ta}\\right)^2}{2\\left(\\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\\right)\\tau_t^2} \\right)\n}+0.01 \\right) \\times  \\frac{1}{ {\\sqrt{2\\pi \\left ( \\eta_{ta}+0.1/A \\right) \\tau_t}} } \\right]\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking the logarithm we obtain the log-likelihood function for the age composition data:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) = -0.5\\sum_{a=1}^A\\sum_{t=1}^T{\n{\\ln{2\\pi \\left( \\eta_{ta}+0.1/A \\right)\n-\\sum_t^T A\\ln\\tau_t}} }\n+\\sum_{a=1}^A\\sum_{t=1}^T{\\ln\\left\\{\n\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{\\left(p_{ta}-\\hat p_{ta}\\right)^2}{\\left(2\\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\\right)\\tau_t^2} \\right)\n+ 0.01 }\n\\right\\}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\[\\begin{align}\n\\eta_{ta} &=  p_{ta}(1-p_{ta})\\\\\n\\text{and} \\\\\n\\tau_t^2 &=  1/n_t\n\\end{align}\\] which gives the variance for \\(p_{ta}\\) \\[\\begin{align}\n(\\eta_{ta}+0.1/A)\\tau_t^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nCompleting the estimation in this fashion reduces the model sensitivity to data that would otherwise be considered outliers.\nWithin the model, predicted survey abundance accounted for within-year mortality since surveys occur during the middle of the year. As in previous years, we assumed that removals by the survey were insignificant (i.e., the mortality of pollock caused by the survey was considered insignificant). Consequently, a set of analogous catchability and selectivity terms were estimated for fitting the survey observations as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat N_{ta}^s &= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere the superscript s indexes the type of survey (AT or BTS). For the option to use the survey predictions in biomass terms instead of just abundance, the above was modified to include observed survey biomass weights-at-age:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat N_{ta}^s &= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}w_{ta}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor the AVO index, the values for selectivity were assumed to be the same as for the AT survey and the mean weights at age over time was also assumed to be equal to the values estimated for the AT survey.\nFor these analyses we chose to keep survey catchabilities constant over time (though they are estimated separately for the AVO index and for the AT and bottom trawl surveys). The contribution to the negative log-likelihood function (ignoring constants) from the surveys is given by either the lognormal distribution:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) &= \\sum_t{\\frac{\\ln(u_t^s/\\hat N_t^s)^2}{2\\sigma_{s,t}^2}}\n\\end{align}\\] where \\(u_t^s\\) is the total (numerical abundance or optionally biomass) estimate with variance \\(\\sigma_{s,t}\\) from survey \\(s\\) in year \\(t\\) or optionally, the normal distribution can be selected: \\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) &= \\sum_t{\\frac{(u_t^s - \\hat N_t^s)^2}{2\\sigma_{s,t}^2}}. \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe AT survey and AVO index is modeled using a lognormal distribution whereas for the BTS survey, a normal distribution was applied.\nFor model configurations in which the BTS data are corrected for estimated efficiency, a multivariate lognormal distribution was used. For the negative- log likelihood component this was modeled as \\[\\begin{equation}\nnll_i = 0.5\\mathbf{X}\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{'}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere is a vector of observed minus model predicted values for this index and \\(\\Sigma\\) is the estimated covariance matrix provided from the method provided in Kotwicki, Ianelli, and Punt (2014). For the VAST estimates, the supplied covariance matrix was used in the same way.\nThe contribution to the negative log-likelihood function for the observed total catch biomass (\\(C_b^{obs}, \\hat{C_b}\\)) by the fishery is given by \\[\\begin{equation}\nnll_i = 0.5\\sum_t\\frac{\\ln(C_b^{obs}/\\hat C_b)^2}{2\\sigma_{C_b,t}^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{C_b,t}\\) is pre-specified (set to 0.05) reflecting the accuracy of the overall observed catch in biomass. Similarly, the contribution of prior distributions (in negative log-density) to the log-likelihood function include \\(\\lambda_\\varepsilon \\sum_t\\varepsilon_t^2 +\\lambda_\\gamma \\sum_{ta}\\gamma^2 + \\lambda_\\delta \\sum_t\\delta_t^2\\) where the size of the ’s represent prior assumptions about the variances of these random variables. Most of these parameters are associated with year-to- year and age specific deviations in selectivity coefficients. For a presentation of this type of Bayesian approach to modeling errors-in- variables, the reader is referred to J. T. Schnute (1994). To facilitate estimating such a large number of parameters, automatic differentiation software extended from Greiwank and Corliss (1991) and developed into C++ class libraries was used. This software provided the derivative calculations needed for finding the posterior mode via a quasi-Newton function minimization routine (e.g., Press et al. (1992)). The model implementation language (ADModel Builder) gave simple and rapid access to these routines and provided the ability estimate the variance-covariance matrix for all dependent and independent parameters of interest.\n\n\n\nThe approach we use to solve for \\(F_{MSY}\\) and related quantities (e.g., \\(B_{MSY}\\) \\(MSY\\)) within a general integrated model context was shown in S. B. Ianelli James N. and Williamson (2001). In 2007 this was modified to include uncertainty in weight-at-age as an explicit part of the uncertainty for \\(F_{MSY}\\) calculations. This involved estimating a vector of parameters (\\(w_{ta}^{future}\\)) on current (r thisyr) and future mean weights for each age \\(i\\), \\(i\\)= (1, 2,…,15), given actual observed mean and variances in weight-at-age over the period 1991-r thisyr-1. The values of based on available data and (if this option is selected) estimates the parameters subject to the natural constraint: \\[w_{ta}^{future} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{w_{a}},\\,\\sigma_{w_a}^{2})\\]\nNote that this converges to the mean values over the time series of data (no other likelihood component within the model is affected by future mean weights-at-age) while retaining the natural uncertainty that can propagate through estimates of \\(F_{MSY}\\) uncertainty. This latter point is essentially a requirement of the Tier 1 categorization.\nSubsequently, this method was refined to account for current-year survey data and both cohort and year effects. The model for this is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat{w}_{ta} &= \\bar w_a e^{\\upsilon_t} & a=1, \\, t \\ge 1964 \\\\\n\\hat{w}_{ta} &= \\hat{w}_{t-1,a-1} + \\Delta_a e^{\\psi_t} & a &gt; 1, \\, t &gt; 1964 \\\\\n\\Delta_a     &= \\bar w_{a+1} - \\bar w_a & a&lt;A  \\\\\n\\bar w_a     &= \\alpha \\left\\{L_1+ \\left(L_2-L_1\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-K^{a-1}}{1-K^{A-1}}\\right)\\right\\}^3  \\\\\n\\end{align}\\] where the fixed effects parameters are \\(L_1, L_2, K,\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) while the random effects parameters are \\(\\upsilon_t\\) and \\(\\psi_t\\).\n\n\n\nTier 1 projections were calculated two ways. First, for r nextyr and r nextyr+1 ABC and \\(OFL\\) levels, the harmonic mean \\(F_{MSY}\\) value was computed and the analogous harvest rate (\\(\\bar{u_{HM}}\\)) applied to the estimated geometric mean fishable biomass at \\(B_{MSY}\\) : \\[\\begin{align}\nABC_t &= B_{GM,t}^f \\hat{u}_{HM}\\zeta_t \\\\\nB_{GM,t}^f &= e^{\\ln{\\hat{B}_t^f}-0.5\\sigma_{B^f}^2} \\\\\nu_{HM,t}^f &= e^{\\ln{\\hat{u}_{MSY,t}}-0.5\\sigma_{u_{MSY}}^2} \\\\\n\\zeta_{t} &= \\frac{B_t/B_{MSY}-0.05}{1-0.05} & B_t &lt; B_{MSY} \\\\\n\\zeta_{t} &= 1.0 & B_t \\ge  B_{MSY}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{B}_t^f\\) is the point estimate of the fishable biomass defined (for a given year): \\(\\sum_a{N_as_{ta}w_{ta}}\\) with \\(N_{ta}\\), \\(s_{ta}\\), and \\(w_{ta}\\) the estimated population numbers (begin year), selectivity and weights-at-age, respectively. \\(B_{MSY}\\) and \\(B_{t}\\) are the point estimates spawning biomass levels at equilibrium \\(F_{MSY}\\) and in year \\(t\\) (at time of spawning). For these projections, catch must be specified (or solved for if in the current year when \\(B_t &lt; B_{MSY}\\)). For longer term projections a form of operating model (as has been presented for the evaluation of \\(B_{20\\%}\\)) with feedback (via future catch specifications) using the control rule and assessment model would be required.",

The catch in numbers at age in year \\(t (C_{t,a})\\) and total catch biomass \\((Y_t)\\) can be described as:s\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    C_{t,a}     &= \\frac{F_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}} \\left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}}\\right) N_{t,a}, &1 \\le t \\le T, 1 \\le a \\le A \\\\\n    N_{t+1,a+1} &= N_{t,a-1} e^{-Z_{t,a-1}}                                       &1 \\le t \\le T, 1 \\le a &lt; A   \\\\\n    N_{t+1,A}   &= N_{t,A-1} e^{-Z_{t,A-1}} + N_{t,A} e^{-Z_{t,A}} ,              &1 \\le t \\le T                \\\\\n    Z_{t,a}     &= F_{t,a} + M_{t,a}                                                                            \\\\\n    C_{t,.}     &= \\sum_{a=1}^A{C_{t,a}}                                                                        \\\\\n    p_{t,a}     &= \\frac{C_{t,a} } {C_{t,.} }                                                                   \\\\\n    Y_{t}       &= \\sum_{a=1}^A{w_{t,a}C_{t,a}}                                                                 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere\nFishing mortality (\\(F_{t,a}\\)) is specified as being semi-separable and non-parametric in form with restrictions on the variability following Butterworth, Ianelli, and Hilborn (2003) :\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    F_{t,a}     &= s_{t,a} \\, \\mu^f e^{\\epsilon_t}, &\\epsilon_t   \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_E^{2}) \\\\\n    s_{t+1,a}   &= s_{t,a} \\,       e^{\\gamma_t},   &\\gamma_t     \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_s^{2})\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(s_{t,a}\\) is the selectivity for age class \\(a\\) in year \\(t\\), and \\(\\mu^f\\) is the median fishing mortality rate over time.\nIf the selectivities (\\(s_{t,a}\\)) are constant over time then fishing mortality rate decomposes into an age component and a year component. A curvature penalty on the selectivity coefficients using the squared second-differences to provide smoothness between ages.\nBottom-trawl survey selectivity was set to be asymptotic yet retain the properties desired for the characteristics of this gear. Namely, that the function should allow flexibility in selecting age 1 pollock over time. The functional form of this selectivity was:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    s_{t,a}     &= \\left[ 1+e^{-\\alpha_ta-\\beta_t} \\right]^{-1} , & a&gt;1 \\\\\n    s_{t,a}     &= \\mu_se^{-\\delta^\\mu_t},                        & a=1 \\\\\n    \\alpha_{t}  &= \\bar \\alpha e^{\\delta^\\alpha_t},                     \\\\\n    \\beta_{t}  &= \\bar \\beta e^{\\delta^\\beta_t},                        \n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere the parameters of the selectivity function follow a random walk process as in Dorn et al. (2000):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    \\delta_t^\\mu  -  \\delta_{t+1}^\\mu     &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{\\delta^\\mu}^{2}) \\\\\n    \\\\\n    \\alpha_t^\\mu  -  \\alpha_{t+1}^\\mu     &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{\\alpha^\\mu}^{2}) \\\\\n    \\beta_t^\\mu  -  \\beta_{t+1}^\\mu     &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{\\beta^\\mu}^{2})\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe parameters to be estimated in this part of the model are thus for t=1982 through to r thisyr. The variance terms for these process error parameters were specified to be 0.04.\nIn this assessment, the random-walk deviation penalty was optionally shifted to the changes in log-selectivity. that is, for the BTS estimates, the process error was applied to the logistic parameters as above, but the lognormal penalty was applied to the resulting selectivities-at-age directly. The extent of this variability was evaluated in the context of the impact on age-specific survey catchability/availability and contrasted with an independent estimate of pollock availability to the bottom trawl survey. \\[\\begin{align}\n    {ln(s_{t,a})}  -  {ln(s_{t+1,a})}  &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_{sel}^{2}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\\] In 2008 the AT survey selectivity approach was modified. As an option, the age one pollock observed in this trawl can be treated as an index and are not considered part of the age composition (which then ranges from age 2-15). This was done to improve some interaction with the flexible selectivity smoother that is used for this gear and was compared. Additionally, the annual specification of input observation variance terms was allowed for the AT data.\nA diagnostic approach to evaluate input variance specifications (via sample size under multinomial assumptions) was added in the 2018 assessment. This method uses residuals from mean ages together with the concept that the sample variance of mean age (from a given annual data set) varies inversely with input sample size. It can be shown that for a given set of input proportions at age (up to the maximum age \\(A\\)) and sample size \\(N_t\\) for year \\(t\\), an adjustment factor \\(\\nu\\) for input sample size can be computed when compared with the assessment model predicted proportions at age (\\(\\hat p_{ta}\\)) and model predicted mean age (\\(\\hat{\\bar{a_t}}\\)): \\[\\begin{align}\n\\nu   &= \\text{var}\\left( r^a_t \\sqrt{\\frac{N_t}{\\kappa_t} }\\right)^{-1} \\\\\nr^a_t &= \\bar a_t - \\hat{\\bar{a_t}}                                      \\\\\n\\kappa_t &= \\left[ \\sum_a^A {\\bar a_t - \\hat{\\bar{a_t}}} \\right]^{0.5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(r^a_t\\) is the residual of mean age and \\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\bar{a_t}} &= \\sum_a^A{a \\hat p_{ta}}\\, \\\\\n{\\bar a_t}      &= \\sum_a^A{a p_{ta}}\\,\n\\end{align}\\]\nBased on previous analyses, we used the above relationship as a diagnostic for evaluating input sample sizes by comparing model predicted mean ages with observed mean ages and the implied 95% confidence bands. This method provided support for modifying the frequency of allowing selectivity changes.",

For the optional Beverton-Holt form (the Ricker form presented in Eq. 12 was adopted for this assessment) we have:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR_t &= \\frac{B_{t-1}e^{\\varepsilon_t} }{\\alpha+\\beta B_{t-1} }\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere\nValues for the stock-recruitment function parameters and are calculated from the values of (the number of 0-year-olds in the absence of exploitation and recruitment variability) and the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship (\\(h\\)). The steepness is the fraction of R0 to be expected (in the absence of recruitment variability) when the mature biomass is reduced to 20% of its pristine level Francis (1992) , so that:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &= \\tilde B_0 \\frac{1-h}{4h} \\\\\n\\beta &= \\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0 }\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde B_0\\) is the total egg production (or proxy, e.g., female spawning biomass) in the absence of exploitation (and recruitment variability) expressed as a fraction of \\(R_0\\).\nSome interpretation and further explanation follows. For steepness equal 0.2, then recruits are a linear function of spawning biomass (implying no surplus production). For steepness equal to 1.0, then recruitment is constant for all levels of spawning stock size. A value of \\(h = 0.9\\) implies that at 20% of the unfished spawning stock size will result in an expected value of 90% unfished recruitment level. Steepness of 0.7 is a commonly assumed default value for the Beverton-Holt form (e.g., Kimura (1989)). The prior distribution for steepness used a beta distribution as in Ianelli et al. (2016). The prior on steepness was specified to be a symmetric form of the Beta distribution with \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 14.93\\) implying a prior mean of 0.5 and CV of 12% (implying that there is about a 14% chance that the steepness is greater than 0.6). This conservative prior is consistent with previous years’ application and serves to constrain the stock-recruitment curve from favoring steep slopes (uninformative priors result in \\(F_{MSY}\\) values near an \\(F_{SPR}\\) of about \\(F_{18\\%}\\) a value considerably higher than the default proxy of \\(F_{35\\%}\\)). The residual pattern for the post-1977 recruits used in fitting the curve with a more diffuse prior resulted in all estimated recruits being below the curve for stock sizes less than \\(B_{MSY}\\) (except for the 1978 year class). We believe this to be driven primarily by the apparent negative-slope for recruits relative to stock sizes above \\(B_{MSY}\\) and as such, provides a potentially unrealistic estimate of productivity at low stock sizes. This prior was elicited from the rationale that residuals should be reasonably balanced throughout the range of spawning stock sizes. Whereas this is somewhat circular (i.e., using data for prior elicitation), the point here is that residual patterns (typically ignored in these types of models) were qualitatively considered.\nIn model 16.1 (from the 2019 assessment), a Beverton Holt stock recruitment form was implemented using the prior value of 0.67 for steepness and a CV of 0.17. This resulted in beta distribution parameters (for the prior) at \\(\\alpha = 6.339\\) and\n\\(\\beta = 4.293\\).\nThe value of \\(\\sigma_R\\) was set at 1.0 to accommodate additional uncertainty in factors affecting recruitment variability.\nTo have the critical value for the stock-recruitment function (steepness, h) on the same scale for the Ricker model, we begin with the parameterization of Kimura (1989) : \\[\\begin{align}\nR_t &= \\frac{B_{t-1}e^{\\alpha \\left(1-B_{t-1} \\frac{R_0}{\\psi_0} \\right)}}{\\psi_0}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIt can be shown that the Ricker parameter a maps to steepness as: \\[\\begin{align}\nh &= \\frac{e^\\alpha}{e^\\alpha+4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nso that the prior used on h can be implemented in both the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment forms. Here the term \\(\\psi_0\\) represents the equilibrium unfished spawning biomass per-recruit.",

    "text": "In 2006 a replay feature was added where the time series of recruitment estimates from a particular model is used to compute the subsequent abundance expectation had no fishing occurred. These recruitments are adjusted from the original estimates by the ratio of the expected recruitment given spawning biomass (with and without fishing) and the estimated stock-recruitment curve. I.e., the recruitment under no fishing is modified as: \\[R_t' = \\hat{R}_t\\frac{f(B_{t-1}')}{f(B_{t-1})}\\] where \\(R_t\\) is the original recruitment estimate in year \\(t\\) with \\(B_{t-1}'\\) and \\(B_{t-1}\\) representing the stock-recruitment function given spawning biomass under no fishing and under the estimated fishing intensity, respectively.\nThe assessment model code allows retrospective analyses (e.g., Parma (1993), and J. N. Ianelli and Fournier (1998)). This was designed to assist in specifying how spawning biomass patterns (and uncertainty) have changed due to new data. The retrospective approach simply uses the current model to evaluate how it may change over time with the addition of new data based on the evolution of data collected over the past several years.\nTo provide a diagnostic for diversity in the age structure of the spawning biomass, we computed the Shannon entropy in exponential form. Following Jost (2006), and substituting the population’s mature age structure in place of species, this provides an estimate of the effective number of ages. This is computed for each year as a measure of different age groups contributing to the spawning population as:\n\\[ H_i = \\exp(-\\sum p_a \\cdot \\log(p_a)) \\]\nwhere \\(p_a\\) is the proportion of mature fish biomass-at-age \\(a\\) in year \\(i\\).",

    "text": "The objective function was simply the sum of the negative log-likelihood function and logs of the prior distributions. To fit large numbers of parameters in nonlinear models it is useful to be able to estimate certain parameters in different stages. The ability to estimate stages is also important in using robust likelihood functions since it is often undesirable to use robust objective functions when models are far from a solution. Consequently, in the early stages of estimation we use the following log- likelihood function for the survey and fishery catch at age data (in numbers):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) &= n \\sum_{t,a}{ p_{ta} \\ln \\hat p_{ta} } \\\\\np_{ta} &= \\frac{O_{ta}}{\\sum_a{O_{ta}}} \\hspace{20pt}\n\\hat p_{ta} = \\frac{\\hat C_{ta}}{\\sum_a{\\hat C_{ta}}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{C} &= \\mathbf{CE}  \\\\\n\\mathbf{E}  &=  \\begin{array}{llll}\nb_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & \\dots & b_{1,15} \\\\\nb_{2,1} & b_{2,2} &       & b_{2,15} \\\\\n\\vdots &         & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\nb_{15,1} & b_{15,2} & \\dots      & b_{15,15}\n\\end{array}  \n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(A\\), and \\(T\\), represent the number of age classes and years, respectively, n is the sample size, and represent the observed and predicted numbers at age in the catch. The elements bi,j represent ageing mis-classification proportions are based on independent agreement rates between otolith age readers. For the models presented this year, the option for including aging errors was re-evaluated.\nSample size values were revised and are shown in the main document. Strictly speaking, the amount of data collected for this fishery indicates higher values might be warranted. However, the standard multinomial sampling process is not robust to violations of assumptions (D. A. Fournier et al. (1990)). Consequently, as the model fit approached a solution, we invoke a robust likelihood function which fit proportions at age as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\prod_{a=1}^A\\prod_{t=1}^T \\left[\\left( \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{\\left(p_{ta}-\\hat p_{ta}\\right)^2}{2\\left(\\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\\right)\\tau_t^2} \\right)\n}+0.01 \\right) \\times  \\frac{1}{ {\\sqrt{2\\pi \\left ( \\eta_{ta}+0.1/A \\right) \\tau_t}} } \\right]\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking the logarithm we obtain the log-likelihood function for the age composition data:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) = -0.5\\sum_{a=1}^A\\sum_{t=1}^T{\n{\\ln{2\\pi \\left( \\eta_{ta}+0.1/A \\right)\n-\\sum_t^T A\\ln\\tau_t}} }\n+\\sum_{a=1}^A\\sum_{t=1}^T{\\ln\\left\\{\n\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{\\left(p_{ta}-\\hat p_{ta}\\right)^2}{\\left(2\\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\\right)\\tau_t^2} \\right)\n+ 0.01 }\n\\right\\}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\[\\begin{align}\n\\eta_{ta} &=  p_{ta}(1-p_{ta})\\\\\n\\text{and} \\\\\n\\tau_t^2 &=  1/n_t\n\\end{align}\\] which gives the variance for \\(p_{ta}\\) \\[\\begin{align}\n(\\eta_{ta}+0.1/A)\\tau_t^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nCompleting the estimation in this fashion reduces the model sensitivity to data that would otherwise be considered outliers.\nWithin the model, predicted survey abundance accounted for within-year mortality since surveys occur during the middle of the year. As in previous years, we assumed that removals by the survey were insignificant (i.e., the mortality of pollock caused by the survey was considered insignificant). Consequently, a set of analogous catchability and selectivity terms were estimated for fitting the survey observations as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat N_{ta}^s &= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere the superscript s indexes the type of survey (AT or BTS). For the option to use the survey predictions in biomass terms instead of just abundance, the above was modified to include observed survey biomass weights-at-age:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat N_{ta}^s &= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}w_{ta}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor the AVO index, the values for selectivity were assumed to be the same as for the AT survey and the mean weights at age over time was also assumed to be equal to the values estimated for the AT survey.\nFor these analyses we chose to keep survey catchabilities constant over time (though they are estimated separately for the AVO index and for the AT and bottom trawl surveys). The contribution to the negative log-likelihood function (ignoring constants) from the surveys is given by either the lognormal distribution:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) &= \\sum_t{\\frac{\\ln(u_t^s/\\hat N_t^s)^2}{2\\sigma_{s,t}^2}}\n\\end{align}\\] where \\(u_t^s\\) is the total (numerical abundance or optionally biomass) estimate with variance \\(\\sigma_{s,t}\\) from survey \\(s\\) in year \\(t\\) or optionally, the normal distribution can be selected: \\[\\begin{align}\nnll(i) &= \\sum_t{\\frac{(u_t^s - \\hat N_t^s)^2}{2\\sigma_{s,t}^2}}. \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe AT survey and AVO index is modeled using a lognormal distribution whereas for the BTS survey, a normal distribution was applied.\nFor model configurations in which the BTS data are corrected for estimated efficiency, a multivariate lognormal distribution was used. For the negative- log likelihood component this was modeled as \\[\\begin{equation}\nnll_i = 0.5\\mathbf{X}\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{'}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere is a vector of observed minus model predicted values for this index and \\(\\Sigma\\) is the estimated covariance matrix provided from the method provided in Kotwicki, Ianelli, and Punt (2014). For the VAST estimates, the supplied covariance matrix was used in the same way.\nThe contribution to the negative log-likelihood function for the observed total catch biomass (\\(C_b^{obs}, \\hat{C_b}\\)) by the fishery is given by \\[\\begin{equation}\nnll_i = 0.5\\sum_t\\frac{\\ln(C_b^{obs}/\\hat C_b)^2}{2\\sigma_{C_b,t}^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{C_b,t}\\) is pre-specified (set to 0.05) reflecting the accuracy of the overall observed catch in biomass. Similarly, the contribution of prior distributions (in negative log-density) to the log-likelihood function include \\(\\lambda_\\varepsilon \\sum_t\\varepsilon_t^2 +\\lambda_\\gamma \\sum_{ta}\\gamma^2 + \\lambda_\\delta \\sum_t\\delta_t^2\\) where the size of the ’s represent prior assumptions about the variances of these random variables. Most of these parameters are associated with year-to- year and age specific deviations in selectivity coefficients. For a presentation of this type of Bayesian approach to modeling errors-in- variables, the reader is referred to J. T. Schnute (1994). To facilitate estimating such a large number of parameters, automatic differentiation software extended from Greiwank and Corliss (1991) and developed into C++ class libraries was used. This software provided the derivative calculations needed for finding the posterior mode via a quasi-Newton function minimization routine (e.g., Press et al. (1992)). The model implementation language (ADModel Builder) gave simple and rapid access to these routines and provided the ability estimate the variance-covariance matrix for all dependent and independent parameters of interest.",

This involved estimating a vector of parameters (\\(w_{ta}^{future}\\)) on current (r thisyr) and future mean weights for each age \\(i\\), \\(i\\)= (1, 2,…,15), given actual observed mean and variances in weight-at-age over the period 1991-r thisyr-1.

This latter point is essentially a requirement of the Tier 1 categorization.\nSubsequently, this method was refined to account for current-year survey data and both cohort and year effects.
