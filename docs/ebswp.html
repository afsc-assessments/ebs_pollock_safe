<p>Relative to last year’s BSAI SAFE report, the following substantive changes have been made in the EBS pollock stock assessment. This includes the 2024 NMFS bottom-trawl survey (BTS) covering the EBS and NBS. As before, these data were treated with a spatio temporal model for index standardization. Age data from this survey effort was compiled and included (also with an extensive spatio-temporal model treatment). The NMFS acoustic-trawl survey (ATS) age composition data was revised from the preliminary estimates developed in 2022. The BTS chartered boats also collected acoustic data and the series was updated this year (AVO). Explorations were presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2023">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Results from integrating the survey and fishery observer data indicate that in 2022 the stock reached about 92% of the all-time peak female spawning biomass estimated from 1987. The values for the recent years appear to have stabilzed well above <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span>.

The first table has the ABC recommendation based on Tier 3 calculation as a proxy reduction from the maximum permissible under Tier 1. The second table repeats the result but is simply as a reclassified Tier 3 table. We provide these as options to guide the SSC in their decisions.

<p>Walleye pollock (<em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>; hereafter referred to as pollock) are broadly distributed throughout the North Pacific with the largest concentrations found in the Eastern Bering Sea. Also known as Alaska pollock, this species continues to play important roles ecologically and economically.</p>

<section id="review-of-life-history" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="review-of-life-history">Review of Life History</h2>
<p>In the EBS pollock generally spawn during March-May and in relatively localized regions during specific periods (<span class="citation" data-cites="bailey2000">Bailey (<a href="#ref-bailey2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> ). Generally spawning begins nearshore north of Unimak Island in March and April and later near the Pribilof Islands (<span class="citation" data-cites="bacheler2010">Bacheler et al. (<a href="#ref-bacheler2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>). Females spawn in batches with up to 10 batches of eggs per female per year (during the peak spawning period). Eggs and larvae of EBS pollock are planktonic for a period of about 90 days and appear to be sensitive to environmental conditions. These conditions likely affect their dispersal into favorable areas (for subsequent separation from predators) and also affect general food requirements for over-wintering survival (<span class="citation" data-cites="gann2015">Gann et al. (<a href="#ref-gann2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="heintz2013">Heintz et al.

(<a href="#ref-ciannelli2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>). <span class="citation" data-cites="duffy2016">Duffy-Anderson et al. (<a href="#ref-duffy2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> provide a review of the early life history of EBS pollock.</p>
<p>Throughout their range juvenile pollock feed on a variety of planktonic crustaceans, including calanoid copepods and euphausiids. In the EBS shelf region, one-year-old pollock are found throughout the water column, but also commonly occur in the NMFS bottom trawl survey. Ages 2 and 3 year old pollock are rarely caught in summer bottom trawl survey gear and are more common in the midwater zone as detected by mid-water acoustic trawl surveys. Younger pollock are generally found in the more northern parts of the survey area and appear to move to the southeast as they age (<span class="citation" data-cites="buckley2009">Buckley et al. (<a href="#ref-buckley2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>). Euphausiids, principally <em>Thysanoessa inermis</em> and <em>T. raschii</em>, are among the most important prey items for pollock in the Bering Sea (<span class="citation" data-cites="livingston1991">Livingston (<a href="#ref-livingston1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="lang2000">Lang et al.

Pollock diets become more piscivorous with age, and cannibalism has been commonly observed in this region. However, <span class="citation" data-cites="buckley2015">Buckley et al. (<a href="#ref-buckley2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> showed spatial patterns of pollock foraging varies by size of predators. For example, the northern part of the shelf region between the 100 and 200 m isobaths (closest to the shelf break) tends to be more piscivorous than pollock found in more near-shore shallow areas.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stock-structure">Stock structure</h2>
<p>Stock structure for EBS pollock was evaluated in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2015">Ianelli et al. (<a href="#ref-ianelli2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. In that review past work on genetics (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="bailey1999">Bailey et al.

(<a href="#ref-canino2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>) provided insight on genetic differentiation. The investigation also compared synchrony in year-classes and growth patterns by region. Pollock samples from areas including Zhemchug Canyon, Japan, Prince William Sound, Bogoslof, Shelikof, and the Northern Bering Sea were processed and results presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2021">Ianelli et al.

(<a href="#ref-ianelli2023a" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> the work noted that the genetic groups mostly aligned with the current stock-management delineations. However, the Aleutian Islands and Bogoslof “stocks” showed subtle differentiation from the GOA management group.</p>

<h1>Fishery</h1>
<section id="description-of-the-directed-fishery" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description-of-the-directed-fishery">Description of the directed fishery</h2>
<p>Historically, EBS pollock catches were low until directed foreign fisheries began in 1964. Catches increased rapidly during the late 1960s and reached a peak in 1970–75 when they ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 million t annually. Following the peak catch in 1972, bilateral agreements with Japan and the USSR resulted in reductions. During a 10-year period, catches by foreign vessels operating in the “Donut Hole” region of the Aleutian Basin were substantial totaling nearly 7 million t (). A fishing moratorium for this area was enacted in 1993 and only trace amounts of pollock have been harvested from the Aleutian Basin region since then. Since the late 1970s, the average EBS pollock catch has been about 1.2 million t, ranging from 0.810 million t in 2009 to nearly 1.5 million t during 2002–2006 (). United States vessels began fishing for pollock in 1980 and by 1988 the fishery became fully domestic. The current observer program for the domestic fishery formally began in 1991 and prior to that, observers were deployed aboard the foreign and joint-venture operations since the late 1970s. From the period 1991 to 2011 about 80% of the catch was observed at sea or during dockside offloading. Since 2011, regulations require that all vessels participating in the pollock fishery carry at least one observer so nearly 100% of the pollock fishing operations are monitored by scientifically trained observers. Starting in 2021, an increasing proportion of shore-based catcher vessels have adopted electronic monitoring devices. This has replaced at-sea observers on these boats. However, the biological sampling continues to occur at about the same rate as previously but with samples obtained during the offloading. Work continues on linking the log-book data withe the EM data so that tow-by-tow estimates can be obtained. Historical catch estimates used in the assessment, along with management measures (i.e., OFLs, ABCs and TACs) are shown in ().</p>
<section id="catch-patterns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="catch-patterns">Catch patterns</h3>
<p>The “A-season” for directed EBS pollock fishing opens on January 20th and fishing typically extends into early-mid April. During this season the fishery targets pre-spawning pollock and produces pollock roe that, under optimal conditions, can comprise over 4% of the catch in weight. The summer, or “B-season” presently opens on June 10th and fishing extends through noon on November 1st. The A-season fishery concentrates primarily north and west of Unimak Island depending on ice conditions and fish distribution. There has also been effort along the 100m depth contour (and deeper) between Unimak Island and the Pribilof Islands. The general pattern by season (and area) has varied over time with recent B-season catches occurring in the southeast portion of the shelf (east of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W longitude; <a href="#fig-catch" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>).</p>
<p>Since 2011, regulations and industry-based measures to reduce Chinook salmon bycatch have affected the spatial distribution of the fishery and to some degree, the way individual vessel operators fish (<span class="citation" data-cites="stram2014">Stram and Ianelli (<a href="#ref-stram2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>). Comparing encounters of bycatch relative to the effort (total duration of all tows) the pollock fleet had a slight increase in the Chinook salmon bycatch rate (<a href="#fig-fsh_psc_cpue" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). The nominal catch rate of sablefish in the pollock fishery continue to be above historical averages (<a href="#fig-fsh_psc_cpue" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>) while for herring, the rate was low compared to 2020.</p>
<p>The catch estimates by sex for the seasons indicate that over time, the number of males and females has been fairly equal but in the period 2017-2022 the A-season catch of females has been slightly higher and conversely, in the B-season there has been a slightly higher number of males taken (<a href="#fig-catch_sex" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). The pattern of catch numbers is impacted by the magnitude of the quota (e.g., the drop in 2022 when the TAC was lower) but also in the relative size of fish. For example, in 2020 estimated absolute numbers of catch were relatively high because fish were smaller (and younger) than average.</p>
<p>The 2023 A-season fishery spatial pattern had a relatively more catch around the Pribilof Islands compared to 2021 (<a href="#fig-catch_distn_a" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>). The amount of fishing near the Pribilof Islands was lower than commonly observed in 2022. The 2023 A-season nominal catch rates were near peak levels for all fleet sectors (middle panel, <a href="#fig-fsh_cpue" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). Beginning in 2017, due to a regulatory change, up to 45% of the TAC could be taken in the A-season (previously only 40% of the TAC could be taken). This conservation measure was made to allow greater flexibility to avoid Chinook salmon in the B-season. The pollock fleet as a whole continues to take advantage of this flexibility (<a href="#fig-prop_a_season" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). This figure shows that the proportion of the TAC has been consistent over time. Pollock roe production remains at a low level but increased over 2022 (<a href="#fig-roe" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>).</p>
<p>The summer-fall fishing conditions for 2023 were similar to 2022 (<a href="#fig-fsh_cpue" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). The number of hours the fleet required to catch the same tonnage of pollock was also improved relative to 2020. In the B-season catches in the northwestern area increased relative to the previous two years (<a href="#fig-catch_distn_b" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8</a>). We updated our work on a measure of fleet dispersion: the relative distance or spread of the fishery in space. Briefly, the calculation computes for a given day, the distance between all trawl tows (within and across boats). These distances are then averaged for year and season. Updated to this year, results indicated that in the A-season dispersion increased slightly but for the B-season in 2023, the fleet appeared to be less dispersed than all the other years and since 2000 (<a href="#fig-fleet_dispersal" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9</a>).</p>
<p>We continued to investigate the tow specific mean weight of fish. These provide a direct mean somatic mass (pollock body weight) for pollock within a tow. The data arise from the sampled total weight (e.g., of several baskets of pollock) divided by the enumerated number of fish in that sample. Such records exist for each tow. Summing these by extrapolated weight of the pollock catch within that tow, and binning by weight increments (here by 50 gram intervals), allows us to obtain some additional fine-scale information on the size trends in the pollock fishery. The annual patterns of these data suggest that the 2023 A-season size was consistent with the expectation of the 2018 year class predominating the catch (<a href="#fig-fsh_wt_freq" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10</a>). However, the 2023 B-season pattern was smaller than expected. Compiling the data by week we show that the fish size was consistent with the pattern of fish being consistently smaller than expected through the B-season (<a href="#fig-fsh_wt_freq_week" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>).</p>
<p>The catch of EBS pollock has averaged 1.26 million t in the period since 1979. The lowest catches occurred in 2009 and 2010 when the limits were set to 0.81 million t due to stock declines (). The recent 5-year average (2019-2023) catch has been 1.304 million t. Pollock catches that are retained or discarded (based on NMFS observer estimates) in the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for 1991–2024 are shown in . Since 1991, estimates of discarded pollock have ranged from a high of 9.6% of total pollock catch in 1991 to recent lows of around 0.6% to 1.2%. These low values reflect the implementation of the NMFS’ Improved Retention /Improved Utilization program. Prior to the implementation of the American Fisheries Act (AFA) in 1999, higher discards may have occurred under the “race for fish” and pollock marketable sizes were caught incidentally. Since implementation of the AFA, the vessel operators have more time to pursue optimal sizes of pollock for market since the quota is allocated to vessels (via cooperative arrangements). In addition, several vessels have made gear modifications to avoid retention of smaller pollock. In all cases, the magnitude of discards counts as part of the total catch for management (to ensure the TAC is not exceeded) and within the assessment. Bycatch of other non-target, target, and prohibited species is presented in the section titled Ecosystem Considerations below. In that section it is noted that the bycatch of pollock in other target fisheries is more than double the bycatch of other target species (e.g., Pacific cod) in the pollock fishery.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="management-measures">Management measures</h2>
<p>The EBS pollock stock is managed by NMFS regulations that provide limits on seasonal catch. The NMFS observer program data provide near real-time statistics during the season and vessels operate within well-defined limits. In most years, the TACs have been set well below the ABC value and catches have stayed within these constraints ). Allocations of the TAC split first with 10% to western Alaska communities as part of the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program and the remainder between at-sea processors and shore-based sectors. For a characterization of the CDQ program see <span class="citation" data-cites="haynie2014">Haynie (<a href="#ref-haynie2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="seung2016">Seung and Ianelli (<a href="#ref-seung2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> combined a fish population dynamics model with an economic model to evaluate regional impacts.</p>
<p>Due to concerns that groundfish fisheries may impact the rebuilding of the Steller sea lion population, a number of management measures have been implemented over the years. Some measures were designed to reduce the possibility of competitive interactions between fisheries and Steller sea lions. For the pollock fisheries, seasonal fishery catch and pollock biomass distributions (from surveys) indicated that the apparent disproportionately high seasonal harvest rates within Steller sea lion critical habitat could lead to reduced sea lion prey densities. Consequently, management measures redistributed the fishery both temporally and spatially according to pollock biomass distributions. This was intended to disperse fishing so that localized harvest rates were more consistent with estimated annual exploitation rates. The measures include establishing: 1) pollock fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookery or haulout sites; 2) phased-in reductions in the seasonal proportions of TAC that can be taken from critical habitat; and 3) additional seasonal TAC releases to disperse the fishery in time.</p>
<p>Prior to adoption of the above management measures, the pollock fishery occurred throughout each of the three major NMFS management regions of the North Pacific Ocean: the Aleutian Islands (1,001,780 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> inside the EEZ), the Eastern Bering Sea (968,600 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>), and the Gulf of Alaska (1,156,100 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>). The marine portion of Steller sea lion critical habitat in Alaska west of 150<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>W encompasses 386,770 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> of ocean surface, or 12% of the fishery management regions.</p>
<p>From 1995–1999 84,100 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, or 22% of the Steller sea lion critical habitat was closed to the pollock fishery. Most of this closure consisted of the 10 and 20 nm radius all-trawl fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookeries (48,920 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, or 13% of critical habitat). The remainder was largely management area 518 (35,180 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, or 9% of critical habitat) that was closed pursuant to an international agreement to protect spawning stocks of central Bering Sea pollock. In 1999, an additional 83,080 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> (21%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian Islands was closed to pollock fishing along with 43,170 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> (11%) around sea lion haulouts in the GOA and Eastern Bering Sea. In 1998, over 22,000 t of pollock were caught in the Aleutian Island region, with over 17,000 t taken within critical habitat region. Between 1999 and 2004 a directed fishery for pollock was prohibited in this region. Subsequently, 210,350 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> (54%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian Islands was closed to the pollock fishery. In 2000 the remaining phased-in reductions in the proportions of seasonal TAC that could be caught within the BSAI Steller sea lion Conservation Area (SCA) were implemented.</p>
<p>On the EBS shelf, an estimate (based on observer at-sea data) of the proportion of pollock caught in the SCA has averaged about 44% annually. During the A-season, the average is also about 44%. Nonetheless, the proportion of pollock caught within the SCA varies considerably, presumably due to temperature regimes and the relative population age structure. The annual proportion of catch has ranged from an annual low of 11% in 2010 to high of 60% in 1998–the 2019 annual value was 58% and quite high again in the A-season (68%). The higher values in recent years were likely due to good fishing conditions close to the main port. The recent transition from at-sea observer sampling of many catcher vessels to a combination of at-sea electronic monitoring and shore-based observer sampling has resulted in a temporary hiatus in to associate catches with specific areas. Work has progressed to link the position information to offloads so that haul records could be used to evaluate fishing patterns.</p>
<p>The AFA reduced the capacity of the catcher/processor fleet and permitted the formation of cooperatives in each industry sector by the year 2000. Because of some of its provisions, the AFA gave the industry the ability to respond efficiently to changes mandated for sea lion conservation and salmon bycatch measures. Without such a catch-share program, these additional measures would likely have been less effective and less economical (<span class="citation" data-cites="strong2014">Strong and Criddle (<a href="#ref-strong2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>An additional strategy to minimize potential adverse effects on sea lion populations is to disperse the fishery throughout more of the pollock range on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf. While the distribution of fishing during the A-season is limited due to ice and weather conditions, there appears to be some dispersion to the northwest area (<a href="#fig-catch_distn_a" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>).</p>
<p>The majority (about 56%) of Chinook salmon caught as bycatch in the pollock fishery originate from western Alaskan rivers. This was updated at the June 2022 Council meeting and is activities are monitored and reported closely at the Council (<a href="https://www.npfmc.org/fisheries-issues/bycatch/salmon-bycatch/">at this website</a>). In summary, additional Chinook salmon bycatch management measures went into effect in 2011 which imposed revised prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. These limits, when reached, close the fishery by sector and season (Amendment 91 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) resulting from the NPFMC’s 2009 action). Previously, all measures for salmon bycatch imposed seasonal area closures when PSC levels reached the limit (fishing could continue outside of the closed areas). The current program imposes a dual cap system by fishing sector and season. A goal of this system was to maintain incentives to avoid bycatch at a broad range of relative salmon abundance (and encounter rates). Participants are also required to take part in an incentive program agreement (IPA). These IPAs are approved and reviewed annually by NMFS to ensure individual vessel accountability. The fishery has been operating under rules to implement this program since January 2011.</p>
<p>Further measures to reduce salmon bycatch in the pollock fishery were developed and the Council took action on Amendment 110 to the BSAI Groundfish FMP in April 2015. These additional measures were designed to add protection for Chinook salmon by imposing more restrictive PSC limits in times of low western Alaskan Chinook salmon abundance. This included provisions within the IPAs that reduce fishing in months of higher bycatch encounters and mandate the use of salmon excluders in trawl nets. These provisions were also included to provide more flexible management measures for chum salmon bycatch within the IPAs rather than through regulatory provisions implemented by Amendment 84 to the FMP. The new measure also included additional seasonal flexibility in pollock fishing so that more pollock (proportionally) could be caught during seasons when salmon bycatch rates were low. Specifically, an additional 5% of the pollock can be caught in the A-season (effectively changing the seasonal allocation from 40% to 45% (as noted above in the discussion assosciated with <a href="#fig-prop_a_season" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). These measures are all part of Amendment 110 and a summary of this and other key management measures is provided in .</p>
<p>There are three time/area closures in regulation to minimize herring PSC impacts: <em>Summer Herring Savings Area 1</em> an area south of 57<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>N latitude and between 162<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W and 164<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W longitude from June 15 through July 1st. <em>Summer Herring Savings Area 2</em> an area south of 56<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> 30’ N latitude and between 164<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W and 167<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W longitude from July 1 through August 15. <em>Winter Herring Savings Area</em> an area between 58<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> and 60<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>N latitude and between 172<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W and 175<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W longitude from September 1st through March 1st of the next fishing year.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="catch">Catch</h3>
<p>Biological sampling by scientifically trained observers form the basis of a major data component of this assessment (as evaluated in Barbeaux et al.&nbsp;2005). The catch-at-age composition was estimated using the methods described by <span class="citation" data-cites="kimura1989">Kimura (<a href="#ref-kimura1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> and modified by <span class="citation" data-cites="dorn1992">Dorn (<a href="#ref-dorn1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>. Length-stratified age data are used to construct age-length keys for each stratum and sex. These keys are then applied to randomly sampled catch length frequency data. The stratum-specific age composition estimates are then weighted by the catch biomass within each stratum to arrive at an overall age composition for each year. Data were collected through shore-side sampling and at-sea observers (<span class="citation" data-cites="barbeaux2005">Barbeaux et al. (<a href="#ref-barbeaux2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). The three strata for the EBS were: i) January–June (all areas, but mainly east of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W); ii) INPFC area 51 (east of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W) from July–December; and iii) INPFC area 52 (west of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W) from July–December. This method was used to derive the age compositions from 1991–2023 (the period for which all the necessary information is readily available). Prior to 1991, we used the same catch-at-age composition estimates as presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="wespestad1996">Wespestad et al. (<a href="#ref-wespestad1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The catch-at-age estimation method uses a two-stage bootstrap re-sampling of the data. Observed tows were first selected with replacement, followed by re- sampling actual lengths and age specimens given that set of tows. This method allows an objective way to specify the starting values for the input sample size for fitting fishery age composition data within the assessment model. In addition, estimates of stratum-specific fishery mean weights-at-age (and variances) are provided which are useful for evaluating general patterns in growth and growth variability. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2007">Ianelli et al. (<a href="#ref-ianelli2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> showed that seasonal aspects of pollock condition factor could affect estimates of mean weight-at-age. They showed that within a year, the condition factor for pollock varies by more than 15%, with the heaviest pollock caught late in the year from October-December (although most fishing occurs during other times of the year) and the thinnest fish at length tending to occur in late winter. They also showed that spatial patterns in the fishery affect mean weights, particularly when the fishery is shifted more towards the northwest where pollock tend to be smaller at age. <span class="citation" data-cites="gruss2021">Grüss et al. (<a href="#ref-gruss2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> showed cold-pool-extent impacts on the spatial map of summer condition and relating environmental conditions to fish condition continues to be an active area of research.</p>
<p>In 2011 the winter fishery catch consisted primarily of age 5 pollock (the 2006 year class) and later in that year age 3 pollock (the 2008 year class) were present. In 2012–2016 the 2008 year class was prominent in the catches with 2015 showing the first signs of the 2012 year-class as three year-olds in the catch (<a href="#fig-catage" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>; ). However, by 2017 the 2013 year-class began to be also evident and surpassed the 2012 year-class in dominance and persist through to 2021. The unusual pattern of switching adjacent year-classes was examined in 2021 to see if there was a pattern of spatial differences. There was a distinct spatial distribution of the different year-classes. Having adjacent strong year-classes appears to be a new characteristic of the stock. In 2020, an unusual presence of age-2 pollock appeared in the catch, along with some from the 2014 year-class while the 2012 year-class was a smaller part of the catch (<a href="#fig-catage" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>). By 2021 and 2022, the predominance of 3- and 4-year olds in the catch<br>
confirms the abundance year-class from 2018. We note that the center of locations of the 2018 year-class, as plotted based on the locales of samples from that cohort, appears to be more oriented to the south east (by age) when compared to another abundant year-class (the 2008; <a href="#fig-fsh_cohort_locales" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;14</a>).</p>
<p>The sampling effort for age determinations, weight-length measurements, and length frequencies is shown in , , and . Sampling for pollock lengths and ages by area has been shown to be relatively proportional to catches. The precision of total pollock catch biomass is considered high with estimated CVs to be on the order of 1% (<span class="citation" data-cites="miller2005">Miller (<a href="#ref-miller2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Scientific research catches are reported to fulfill requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act. The annual estimated research catches (1963–2022) from NMFS surveys in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Region are given in (). Since these values represent extremely small fractions of the total removals (about 0.02%) they are ignored for assessment purposes.</p>

<section id="bottom-trawl-survey-bts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bottom-trawl-survey-bts">Bottom trawl survey (BTS)</h3>
<p>Trawl surveys have been conducted annually by the AFSC to assess the abundance of crab and groundfish in the Eastern Bering Sea since 1979 and since 1982 using standardized gear and methods. For pollock, this survey has been instrumental in providing an abundance index and information on the population age structure. This survey is complemented by the acoustic trawl (AT) surveys that sample mid-water components of the pollock stock. Between 1991 and 2023 the BTS biomass estimates ranged from 2.28 to 8.39 million t () for the design-based estimates). The values used for the assessment (VAST index, see <a href="#sec-vast" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;16</a> for details) are shown in <a href="#fig-bts_biom" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;15</a>. In the mid-1980s and early 1990s several years resulted in above-average biomass estimates. The stock appeared to be at lower levels during 1996–1999 then increased moderately until about 2003 and since then has averaged just over 4 million t (from the standard EBS region using design-based estimators).</p>
<p>These surveys also provide consistent measurements of environmental conditions, such as the sea surface and bottom temperatures. Large-scale zoogeographic shifts in the EBS shelf documented during a warming trend in the early 2000s were attributed to temperature changes (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="mueter2008">Mueter and Litzow (<a href="#ref-mueter2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>). However, after the period of relatively warm conditions ended in 2005, the next eight years were mainly below average, indicating that the zoogeographic responses may be less temperature-dependent than they initially appeared (<span class="citation" data-cites="kotwicki2013">Kotwicki and Lauth (<a href="#ref-kotwicki2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>). Bottom temperatures increased in 2011 to about average from the low value in 2010 but declined again in 2012–2013. In the period 2014–2016, bottom temperatures increased and reached a new high in 2016. In 2018 bottom temperatures were nearly as warm (after 2017 was slightly above average) but was highly unusual due to the complete lack of “cold pool” (i.e., a defined area where water near bottom was less than zero degrees. In 2019, the mean bottom temperature was the warmest during the period the survey has occurred (since 1982; <a href="#fig-bts_temp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;16</a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="rohan2022">Rohan et al. (<a href="#ref-rohan2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>). For the period 2022-2024, the bottom temperatures have been near average.</p>
<p>The AFSC has expanded the area covered by the bottom trawl survey over time. In 1987 the “standard survey area” comprising 6 main strata was increased farther to the northwest and covered in all subsequent years. These two northern strata have varied in estimated pollock abundance. In 2024 about 0.9% of the pollock biomass was found in these strata compared to a long term average of 5% (). Importantly, this region is contiguous with the Russian border and the NBS region, and treatment of the extent stock shifts between regions continues (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="oleary2021">O’Leary et al. (<a href="#ref-oleary2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>The 2024 survey estimate is the highest estimate since 2019, 90% higher than the 2023 estimate and 36% higher than the time-series mean. The 2024 pollock density by station increased relative to 2023, with the largest increases along the shelf (<a href="#fig-bts_3d" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;17</a>). The VAST model provides density-weighted population shifts in distribution. This can be expressed in north-south and east-west trends over time. A representation of such center of gravity estimates indicate that the stock has moved steadily north since the mid 2000s, but shifted south in 2022 and is slightly further south in 2024, after a northward shift in 2023. The stock center of gravity also moved east from 2010 to about 2017, then shifted west. The 2024 estimate is further west than in 2023 (<a href="#fig-cog" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;18</a>).</p>
<p>The BTS abundance-at-age estimates show variability in year-class strengths with substantial consistency over time (<a href="#fig-bts_age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;19</a>). The abundance of 5-year old pollock (the 2018 year-class) decreased from 2022 to 2023, but increased again in 2024 and represents the most abundant year class. The abundance of age-1 pollock in 2024 appears to be slightly above average and is the highest since 2019.</p>
<p>Pollock above 40 cm in length generally appear to be fully selected and in some years, many 1-year olds occur on or near the bottom (with modal lengths around 10–19 cm). Generally speaking, age 2 or 3 pollock (lengths around 20–29 cm and 30–39 cm, respectively) are relatively rare in this survey because they tend to be more pelagic as juveniles. Compared to recent years, pollock lengthed around 20–25 and 40–45 cm were more abundant in 2024. The size compositions were consistent with the age data (<a href="#fig-bts_lenfreq" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;20</a>).</p>
<p>Observed fluctuations in survey estimates may be attributed to a variety of sources including unaccounted-for variability in natural mortality, survey catchability, and <strong>horizontal</strong> migrations and <strong>vertical availability</strong> (<span class="citation" data-cites="monnahan2021">Monnahan et al. (<a href="#ref-monnahan2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="oleary2022">O’Leary et al. (<a href="#ref-oleary2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>). As an example, some strong year classes appear in the surveys over several ages (e.g., the 1989 year class) while others appear only at older ages (e.g., the 1992 and 2008 year class). Sometimes, initially strong year classes appear to wane in successive assessments (e.g., the 1996 year class estimate (at age 1) dropped from 43 billion fish in 2003 to 32 billion in 2007 (<span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2007">Ianelli et al. (<a href="#ref-ianelli2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>)). Retrospective analyses (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="parma1993">Parma (<a href="#ref-parma1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>) have also highlighted these patterns, as presented in Ianelli et al.&nbsp;(2006, 2011). <span class="citation" data-cites="kotwicki2013">Kotwicki and Lauth (<a href="#ref-kotwicki2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> also found that the catchability of either the BTS or AT survey for pollock is variable in space and time because it depends on environmental variables, and is density-dependent in the case of the BTS survey.</p>
<p>The 2024 survey age compositions were developed from age-structures collected during the survey (June-August) and processed at the AFSC labs within a few weeks after the survey was completed. The level of sampling for lengths and ages in the BTS is shown in . The estimated numbers-at- age from the BTS for strata 1–9 (except for 1982–84 and 1986, when only strata 6 were surveyed) are presented in (based on the method in <span class="citation" data-cites="kotwicki2014">Kotwicki et al. (<a href="#ref-kotwicki2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> and then using VAST–see <a href="#sec-vast" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;16</a> for those details). Compared to the previous design-based age composition estimates, those derived from the spatio-temporal model were generally very similar (see <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2023">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In the previous assessments, the BTS mean body mass-at-ages was computed based on the sex-specific mean length-at-age in each year and converted to weight using sex-specific length-weight parameters that were estimated from data prior to 1999. In reconsidering this approach, data on weight-at-age from intervening years have become available and some new methods applied including those corrected by spatio-temporal modeling (<span class="citation" data-cites="indivero2023">Indivero et al. (<a href="#ref-indivero2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>). This work was adopted in 2022 and values used are shown in . The time series of BTS survey indices is shown in .</p>
<p>The NBS survey area was sampled in 2010, 2017, 2018 (limited to 49 stations), 2019, and 2021-2023. Given that the pollock abundance was quite high in 2017 and 2018, a method for incorporating this information as part of the standard survey was desired. One approach for constructing a full time series that includes the NBS area is to use observed spatial and temporal correlations. We used the vector-autoregressive spatial temporal (VAST) model of <span class="citation" data-cites="thorson2018b">Thorson (<a href="#ref-thorson2018b" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> together with the density-dependent corrected CPUE values from each station (including stations where pollock were absent; ). Please refer to the <a href="#sec-vast" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;16</a> for further details on the implementation. The appendix also includes results that indicate the VAST model diagnostics are reasonable and provide consistent interpretations relative to the observations. Notably, results indicate increased uncertainty in years and areas when stations were missing. As noted in past assessments, application of this index within the stock assessment model required accounting for the time-series covariance estimate.</p>
<p>To date, given other commitments, work on comparing the age-and-growth from NBS samples has stalled. We hope to evaluate these data when they become available in the near future to look at maturity and growth conditions from this region.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acoustic-trawl-surveys">Acoustic trawl surveys</h3>
<p>Acoustic trawl surveys are typically conducted every other year and are designed to estimate the off-bottom component of the pollock stock (compared to the BTS which are conducted annually and provide an abundance index of the near-bottom pollock). Estimated pollock biomass for the EBS shelf has averaged 3.2 million t since the time-series was revised to include the water column to 0.5 m (previously the estimates were from 3 m off bottom to the surface) starting in 1994 (). The early 2000s (a relatively ‘warm’ period) were characterized by low pollock recruitment, which was subsequently reflected in lower pollock biomass estimates between 2006 and 2012 (a ‘cold’ period; <span class="citation" data-cites="honkalehto2015">Honkalehto and McCarthy (<a href="#ref-honkalehto2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>). In 2014 and 2016 (another ‘warm’ period) with the growth of the strong 2012 year class, AT biomass estimates increased to over 4 million t (). The number of trawl hauls, lengths, and ages sampled from the AT survey are presented in . These surveys have also provided insight on the relative abundance of pollock in areas considered critical to Steller sea lions (the “SCA”; ).</p>
<p>The 2024 AT survey was conducted over the EBS shelf between ~60 m depth and the shelf break during Leg 1 (11-24 June) and Leg 2 (30th June through the 19th of July). Survey transects were spaced at 40 nmi (rather than the normal 20 nmi) with fewer sea days available due to limited funding (usually we have 9 weeks, in 2024 we were initially allotted 6). Survey timing was similar to the survey timing in 2018 and 2022, though survey duration was shorter in 2024. The 5-day delayed start to Leg 1 due to ship staffing issues, a 1-day delayed start to Leg 2 due to flight delays, and an outbreak of COVID-19 onboard during Leg 2 contributed to loss of sea days. After the survey area coverage was completed at 40 nmi transect resolution, there was sufficient time to add transects on the northwestern shelf where historically most juveniles have been observed. This resulted in transects at 20 nmi spacing between 172° W and the US-Russia maritime boundary.” The areas east of 170°W was surveyed from 11-22 June and west of 170°W was surveyed from the 23rd of June through July 17.</p>
<p>The estimated amount of pollock in the core survey area in 2024 was 11.4 billion fish with a biomass of 2.87 million metric tons (t), a 25% decrease from the estimate of 9.67 billion fish with a biomass of 3.8 million t in 2022. This was a 20% decrease from the 3.617 million t estimated in 2020 by the acoustics-only Saildrone survey, and 10% below the survey mean of 3.2 million tons for all surveys from 1994-2022. Preliminary population age estimates from 2024 using the length compositions applied to the BTS age-length key (). Six-year-old pollock (2018 year class) dominated the estimated population numbers and comprised 47% of the biomass. The 5-year-olds (2019 year class) represented 15% of the biomass estimate. The age-1+ walleye pollock biomass in midwater was concentrated primarily between the 100 m contour and the shelf break, particularly north and west of Unimak Pass, and between Zhemchug Canyon and Pervenets Canyon. Presumed age 1 pollock (&lt;20 cm FL) were found both east of the Pribilofs, near Unimak Pass, which is unusual, and on the northwestern shelf, which is more common. The majority of the biomass in 2024 was presumed age-4+ fish, with 40% of that biomass found east of 170° W, and 60% found west of 170° W.</p>
<p>Relative estimation errors for the total biomass for the ATS time series were derived from a one-dimensional (1D) geostatistical method, which accounts for observed spatial structure for sampling along transects (<span class="citation" data-cites="petitgas1993">Petitgas (<a href="#ref-petitgas1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="walline2007">Walline (<a href="#ref-walline2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="williamson1996">Williamson and Traynor (<a href="#ref-williamson1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>) The 2024 relative estimation error for the core survey area was 0.056, slightly higher than the time series mean of 0.045, likely due to increased transect spacing. As in previous assessments, the other sources of error (e.g., target strength, trawl selectivity) were accounted for by inflating the annual error estimates to have an overall average CV of 20% for application within the assessment model.</p>

<p>Acoustic backscatter data (Simrad ES60, 38 kHz) were collected aboard two fishing vessels chartered for the AFSC summer 2024 bottom trawl surveys (F/V Alaska Knight, F/V Northwest Explorer). We processed these Acoustic Vessels of Opportunity (AVO) data each year since 2006 to provide an index of age-1+ midwater pollock abundance. As with last year, we implemented a new subsampling methodology (<span class="citation" data-cites="levine2019">Levine and De Robertis (<a href="#ref-levine2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) to generate a more spatially extensive AVO index. In developing the new index, we analyzed a 10% systematic subsample of the BTS backscatter data throughout the typical ATS geographic footprint. The new methods were applied to reanalyze years 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014-2019, and 2021-2024 For the remaining 5 years of the time series, the original AVO index (<span class="citation" data-cites="honkalehto2011">Honkalehto et al.

These pre-publication results are given below (noting that the final results are unlikely to change):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The 2024 AVO index of midwater pollock abundance on the EBS shelf was 2.01 million t, which decreased 19% from 2023 and 31% from 2022. Although not the lowest estimate in the time series, it is the lowest estimate since 2014. This compares with the 2024 AFSC biennial acoustic-trawl survey (ATS) conducted using NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson decreased 25% from 2022.</p></li>
<li><p>The correlation between the AVO index and the AT survey biomass remained the same (r^2= 0.895, n= 9 surveys).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution of pollock backscatter east and west of the Pribilof Islands was average since 2009 (33%).</p></li>
<li><p>The strongest pollock backscatter during the AVO and AT surveys was measured along the southern portion of the EBS shelf. The center of gravity estimate for the 2024 AVO survey was similar to that of the AVO 2022 and 2023 estimates, whereas the center of gravity estimate for the 2024 AT survey was shifted southeast compared to the AT 2022 estimate, and more similar to the AVO 2022-2024 center of gravity estimates (<a href="#fig-cog_AVO_ATS" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;22</a>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Relative to the original index, the correlation between the AVO index and the AT survey biomass was higher (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9, compared to R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6 for the same seven ATS-BTS years from the original index). The new and rescaled index trend dropped 15% relative to 2022 but still is 13% above the long-term mean (<a href="#fig-avo" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;23</a>, ; note that the relative error is based on a variance estimation from (<span class="citation" data-cites="petitgas1993">Petitgas (<a href="#ref-petitgas1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>), while the final magnitude of the error term was ascertained based on other model components via an iterative re-weighting process as noted in Ianelli (2023)). The densest spatial distribution of pollock backscatter was predominantly measured along the southern portion of the EBS shelf in the northwest half of the index area (<a href="#fig-data_avomap" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;24</a>). The three grid cells (20 by 20 nautical mile grids used for annual bottom-trawl survey stations) having the strongest pollock backscatter were 2<sup>o</sup> south of St.&nbsp;Matthew Island close to (58<sup>o</sup>N, 172<sup>o</sup>W) and attributed to dense midwater pollock aggregations.</p>

<p>In the 2019 assessment, the spatio-temporal model fit to BTS CPUE data <em>including stations from the NBS</em> was expanded using the VAST methods detailed in <span class="citation" data-cites="thorson2018">Thorson (<a href="#ref-thorson2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. This data treatment was included as a model alternative and adopted for ABC/OFL specifications by the SSC in 2020 along with other modifications including a spatio-temporal treatment of the age composition data. This year, we examined additional model and data modifications as presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2023">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By the SSC’s numbering scheme, last year’s model was designated Model 23.0, which here we contrast with the impact of new data made available in this year.</p>
<p>As noted in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2024">Ianelli and McGilliard (<a href="#ref-ianelli2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024b</a>)</span>, we continue to provide some facility to test different stock assessment software (as noted in <span class="citation" data-cites="li2021">Li et al.

<section id="input-sample-size" class="level3">

<p>Sample sizes for age-composition data were re-evaluated in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2023">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> and found to be consistent with the relative variability allowed for selectivities and with the observation errors specified for the indices. Principally, this work resulted in tuning the recent era (1991-present year) to an average sample sizes of 350 for the fishery and then using estimated values for the period 1978-1990 and as earlier (). As rationalized in earlier assessments, we found that assuming average values of 100 and 50 for the BTS and ATS data, respectively resulted in consistent model fits and were (relatively) appropriate given the sampling levels among these surveys (using <span class="citation" data-cites="francis2011">Francis (<a href="#ref-francis2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, equation TA1.8). The inter-annual variability reflects the variability in the number of hauls sampled for ages in the ATS data. For the BTS data we adopted the results presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="hulson2023">Hulson et al. (<a href="#ref-hulson2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> (with the time series updated this year <span class="citation" data-cites="afscISS">Hulson and Williams (<a href="#ref-afscISS" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Recent work has shown ways to improve estimation schemes that deal with the interaction between flexibility in fishery selectivity and statistical properties of composition data sample size. Specifically, the Dirichlet-multinomial using either Laplace approximation (<span class="citation" data-cites="thorson2015">Thorson et al.

<p>The M23 model specification used constant natural mortality rates at age (M=0.9, 0.45, and 0.3 for ages 1, 2, and 3+ respectively (<span class="citation" data-cites="wespestad1984">Wespestad and Terry (<a href="#ref-wespestad1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>). When predation was explicitly considered estimates tended to be higher and more variable (Holsman et al.&nbsp;<em>this volume</em>; <span class="citation" data-cites="holsman2015">Holsman and Aydin (<a href="#ref-holsman2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="livingston1998">Livingston and Methot (<a href="#ref-livingston1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="hollowed2000">Hollowed et al.

(<a href="#ref-clark1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span> found that specifying a conservative (lower) natural mortality rate may be advisable when natural mortality rates are uncertain. More recent studies confirm this (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson2014">Johnson et al. (<a href="#ref-Johnson2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>). In <span class="citation" data-cites="ianellisept">Ianelli and McGilliard (<a href="#ref-ianellisept" role="doc-biblioref">2024a</a>)</span> a research model with the estimated <em>M</em> at-age and year matrix was applied. The SSC noted that further refinements to the CEATTLE model may hold promise for future application and sensitivities.</p>
<p>As in past years the estimates indicate higher values than used here. In the 2018 assessment we evaluated natural mortality, and it was noted that the survey age compositions favored lower values of <em>M</em> while the fishery age composition favored higher values. This is consistent with the patterns seen in the BTS survey data as they show increased abundances of “fully selected” cohorts. Hence, given the model specification (asymptotic selectivity for the BTS age composition data), lower natural mortality rates would be consistent with those data. Given these trade-offs, structural model assumptions were held to be the same as previous years for consistency (i.e., the mortality schedule presented below).</p>
<p>Maturity-at-age values used for the EBS pollock assessment were originally based on <span class="citation" data-cites="smith1981">Smith (<a href="#ref-smith1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981</a>)</span> and were later reevaluated via histological methods (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="stahl2004">Stahl (<a href="#ref-stahl2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="Stahl2008">Stahl and Kruse (<a href="#ref-Stahl2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2005">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). These studies found year-class effects and some inter-annual variability but general consistency with the original schedule of proportion mature at age.</p>
<p>With respect to assumptons about natural mortality, we evaluated applying results from an adjacent stock (<span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2022bogoslof">Ianelli and McKelvey (<a href="#ref-ianelli2022bogoslof" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>) in the 2022 assessment. We found the results were consistent with past assumptions therefore again applyed the following age-specific values for <em>M</em> (<span class="citation" data-cites="smith1981">Smith (<a href="#ref-smith1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981</a>)</span>) and maturity-at-age:</p>

<section id="length-and-weight-at-age" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="length-and-weight-at-age">Length and weight-at-age</h3>
<p>Age determination methods have been validated for pollock (<span class="citation" data-cites="kimura1992">Kimura et al. (<a href="#ref-kimura1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="kimura2006">Kimura et al. (<a href="#ref-kimura2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="kastelle2006">Kastelle and Kimura (<a href="#ref-kastelle2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>). EBS pollock size-at-age show important differences in growth with differences by area, year, and year class. Pollock in the northwest area are typically smaller at age than pollock in the southeast area. The differences in average weight-at-age are taken into account by stratifying estimates of catch-at-age by year, area, season, and weighting estimates proportional to catch.</p>
<p>The assessment model for EBS pollock accounts for numbers of individuals in the population. As noted above, management recommendations are based on allowable catch levels expressed as tons of fish. While estimates of pollock catch-at-age are based on large data sets, the data are only available up until the most recent completed calendar year of fishing (e.g., 2022 for this year). Consequently, estimates of weight-at-age in the current year are required to map total catch biomass (typically equal to the quota) to numbers of fish caught (in the current year). Therefore, if there are errors (or poorly accounted uncertainty) in the current and future mean weight-at-age, this can translate directly into errors between the expected fishing mortality and what mortality occurs. For example, if the mean weight-at-age is biased high, then an ABC (and OFL) value will result in greater numbers of fish being caught (and fishing mortality being higher due to more fish fitting within the ABC).</p>
<p>As in previous assessments, we explored patterns in size-at-age and fish condition. Using the NMFS fishery observer data on weight given length we:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>extracted all data where non-zero measurements of pollock length and weight were available between the lengths of 35 and 60 cm for the EBS region</p></li>
<li><p>computed the mean value of body mass (weight) for each cm length bin over all areas and time</p></li>
<li><p>divided each weight measurement by that mean cm-specific value (the “standardization” step)</p></li>
<li><p>plotted these standardized values by different areas, years, months etc. to evaluate condition differences (pooling over ages is effective as there were no size-specific biases apparent)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the first instance, the overarching seasonal pattern in body mass relative to the mean shows that as the winter progresses prior to peak spawning, pollock are generally skinnier than average whereas in July, the median is about average (<a href="#fig-fsh_lw_month" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;25</a>). As the summer/fall progresses, fish were at their heaviest given length (<a href="#fig-fsh_lw_month" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;25</a>). This is also apparent when the data are aggregated by A- and B-seasons (and by east and west of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W; referred to as SE and NW respectively) when plotted over time (<a href="#fig-fsh_lw_anom_str_yr_box" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;26</a>, where stratum 1 = A season, stratum 2 = B season SE, and stratum 3 = B season NW). Combining across seasons, the fishery data shows that recent years were below average weight given length (<a href="#fig-fsh_lw_anom_yr_box" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;27</a> ; note that the anomalies are based on the period 1991-2023).</p>
<p>Examining the weight-at-age, there are also patterns of variability that vary due to environmental conditions in addition to spatial and temporal patterns of the fishery. Based on the bootstrap distributions and large sample sizes, the within-year sampling variability for pollock is small. However, the between-year variability in mean weights-at-age is relatively high (). The coefficients of variation between years are on the order of 6% to 9% (for the ages that are targeted) whereas the sampling variability is generally around 1% or 2%. The approach to account for the identified mean weight-at-age having clear year and cohort effects was continued (e.g., <a href="#fig-fsh_wtage_comb" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;28</a>). Details were provided in appendix 1A of Ianelli et al.&nbsp;(2016). The results from this method showed the relative variability between years and cohorts and provide estimates for 2024–2026 (). How these fishery weights-at-age estimates can be supplemented using survey weights-at-age is further illustrated in <a href="#fig-fish_wtage_data_pred" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;29</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2020 and 2021 fishery, the average weight-at-age for ages 6-8 (the 2012-2014 year classes) was below the time series average. These cohorts have fluctuated around their means in recent years (<a href="#fig-fsh_wtage_comb" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;28</a>). To examine this more closely, we split the bootstrap results into area-season strata and were able to get an overall picture of the pattern by strata (<a href="#fig-fsh_wtage_strata" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;30</a> and <a href="#fig-fsh_wtage_strata_yr" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;31</a>). This showed that the mean weight-at-age is higher in the the B-season in the area east of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W compared to the A-season and B-season in the area west of 170<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>W.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parameters-estimated-within-the-assessment-model">Parameters estimated within the assessment model</h2>
<p>For the selected model, 1366 parameters were estimated conditioned on data and model assumptions. Initial age composition, subsequent recruitment, and stock- recruitment parameters account for 80 parameters. This includes vectors describing the initial age composition (and deviation from the equilibrium expectation) in the first year (as ages 2–15 in 1964) and the recruitment mean and deviations (at age 1) from 1964–2024 and projected recruitment variability (using the variance of past recruitments) for five years (2025–2030). The two- parameter stock-recruitment curve (see <a href="#sec-model" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;14</a>) is included in addition to a term that allows the average recruitment before 1964 (that comprises the initial age composition in that year) to have a mean value different from subsequent years. Note that the stock-recruit relationship is fit only to stock and recruitment estimates from 1979 year-class through to the 2022 year-class.</p>
<p>Fishing mortality is parameterized to be semi-separable with year and age (selectivity) components. The age component is allowed to vary over time; changes are allowed in each year. The mean value of the age component is constrained to equal one and the last 5 age groups (ages 11–15) are specified to be equal. This latter specification feature is intended to reduce the number of parameters while acknowledging that pollock in this age-range are likely to exhibit similar life-history characteristics (i.e., unlikely to change their relative availability to the fishery with age). The annual components of fishing mortality result in 61 parameters and the age-time selectivity schedule forms a 10x61 matrix of 610 parameters bringing the total fishing mortality parameters to 671. The rationale for including time- varying selectivity has recently been supported as a means to improve retrospective patterns (<span class="citation" data-cites="szuwalski2018">Szuwalski et al. (<a href="#ref-szuwalski2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>) and as best practice (<span class="citation" data-cites="martell2013">Martell and Stewart (<a href="#ref-martell2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>For surveys and indices, the treatment of the catchability coefficient, and interactions with age-specific selectivity require consideration. For the BTS index, selectivity-at-age is estimated with a logistic curve in which year specific deviations in the parameters is allowed. Such time-varying survey selectivity is estimated to account for changes in the availability of pollock to the survey gear and is constrained by pre-specified variance terms. Presently, these variance terms have been set based on balancing input data-based variances and are somewhat subjective. For the AT survey, which originally began in 1979 (the current series including data down to 0.5 m from bottom begins in 1994), optional parameters to allow for age and time-varying patterns exist but for this assessment and other recent assessments, ATS selectivity is constant over time. Overall, four catchability coefficients were estimated: one each for the early fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data (from Low and Ikeda, 1980), the VAST combined bottom trawl survey index, the AT survey data, and the AVO data. An uninformative prior distribution is used for all of the indices. The selectivity parameters for the 2 main indices (BTS and ATS) total 336 (the CPUE and AVO data mirror the fishery and AT survey selectivities, respectively).</p>
<p>Additional fishing mortality rates used for recommending harvest levels are estimated conditionally on other outputs from the model. For example, the values corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(F_{40\%}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(F_{35\%}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> harvest rates are found by satisfying the constraint that, given age-specific population parameters (e.g., selectivity, maturity, mortality, weight-at-age), unique values exist that correspond to these fishing mortality rates. The likelihood components that are used to fit the model can be categorized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total catch biomass (log-normal, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=0.05\)</span>)</li>
<li>Log-normal indices of pollock biomass; bottom trawl surveys assume annual estimates of sampling error, as represented in <a href="#fig-bts_biom" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;15</a> along with the covariance matrices (for the density-dependent and VAST index series); for the AT index the annual errors were specified to have a mean CV of 0.20; while for the AVO data, a value a mean CV was tuned for consistency with other data and resulted in a value of 23%).</li>
<li>Fishery and survey proportions-at-age estimates (multinomial with effective sample sizes presented ).</li>
<li>Age 1 index from the AT survey (CV set equal to 30% as in prior assessments).</li>
<li>Selectivity constraints: penalties/priors on age-age variability, time changes, and decreasing (with age) patterns.</li>
<li>Stock-recruitment: penalties/priors involved with fitting a stochastic stock-recruitment relationship within the integrated model.</li>
<li>“Fixed effects” terms accounting for cohort and year sources of variability in fishery mean weights-at-age estimated based on available data from 1991-2023 from the fishery (and 1982-2024 for the bottom-trawl survey data) and externally estimated variance terms as described in Appendix 1A of Ianelli et al.&nbsp;(2016; see <a href="#fig-fish_wtage_data_pred" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;29</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Work evaluating temperature and predation-dependent effects on the stock- recruitment estimates continues (<span class="citation" data-cites="Spencer2016">Spencer et al.

This approach modified the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship by including the effect of temperature and predation mortality. A relationship between recruitment residuals and temperature was noted (similar to that found in <span class="citation" data-cites="mueter2011">Mueter et al.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fishery-selectivity-for-projections">Fishery selectivity for projections</h3>
<p>The SSC requested a clear development on the assumptions of what selectivity estimates should be used for projections. The model estimates vary by year and this can affect recommendations for ABC and OFL. For example, in 2021, the selectivity estimates shifted dramatically towards younger fish due to the appearance of two-year old pollock in 2020. In such cases, the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> (or proxy) will generally be lower since the basis is on the conservation of reproductive biomass. To evaluate the impact of choice in selecting the selectivity estimates to use for projection purposes, we tested the following scenarios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The selectivity estimates from the most recent year was used for projections. (<strong>most-recent</strong>)</li>
<li>The selectivity estimates from the most recent 2-year mean was used for projections. (<strong>2-yr-avg</strong>)</li>
<li>The selectivity estimates from the most recent 3-year mean was used for projections. (<strong>3-yr-avg</strong>)</li>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>The input sample size (as tuned in 2016 using “Francis Weights”) can be evaluated visually for consistency with expectations of mean annual age for the different gear types (<a href="#fig-mod_mean_age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;37</a>; <span class="citation" data-cites="francis2011">Francis (<a href="#ref-francis2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>). The estimated selectivity pattern changes over time and reflects to some degree the extent to which the fishery is focused on particularly prominent year-classes (<a href="#fig-mod_fsh_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;38</a>). The model fits the fishery age-composition data quite well under this form of selectivity (<a href="#fig-mod_fsh_age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;39</a>).</p>
<p>Bottom-trawl survey selectivity estimates are shown in <a href="#fig-mod_bts_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;40</a>. The pattern of bottom trawl survey age composition data in recent years shows a decline in the abundance of age 10+ pollock since 2011 (<a href="#fig-mod_bts_age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;41</a>). Through the time series of the available data, the model predicted proportions of the 2012 and 2013 year classes varied in terms of under- and over- estimates as the 2013 year-class became more common in the data (<a href="#fig-mod_bts_age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;41</a>). The ATS selectivity varies slightly among ages and years (<a href="#fig-mod_ats_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;42</a>). This enhances the fit to the age composition data while still tracking the large year classes through the population (<a href="#fig-mod_ats_age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;43</a>).</p>
<p>As in past assessments, we evaluated the multivariate posterior distribution using Monte-Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) simulation methods. This year we adopted the no-uturn sampling approach from ADMB but upgraded and packaged within R (adnuts, <span class="citation" data-cites="monnahan2018">Monnahan and Kristensen (<a href="#ref-monnahan2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>). This allowed thorough sampling diagnostics and was able to sample the posterior efficiently within a few hours (or less). This new package also demonstrated that the asymptotic parameter standard deviations were reasonable approximations of the marginal densities from the integrated posterior distribution (<a href="#fig-MLE_v_post" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;47</a>). As before, we evaluated how selected parameters relate by doing a pairwise (along with their marginal distributions; <a href="#fig-mcmc_pairs" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;48</a>). This illustrates how key parameters relate to management parameters of interest. For example, the stock recruitment steepness is negatively correlated to the resulting <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> estimate. We also compare the point estimates (highest posterior density) with the mean of the posterior marginal distribution of the 2024 spawning biomass. This showed that the point estimate was similar to the mean of the marginal posterior distribution (<a href="#fig-mcmc_marg" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;49</a>). As an additional part of the Tier 1 consideration, we evaluated the posterior density of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> and is provided in <a href="#fig-mcmc_marg_fmsy" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;50</a> for reference.</p>
<p>We added code for producing posterior predictive distributions (e.g., for the two acoustic indices in <a href="#fig-acoustic_ppl" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;51</a>. Additionally, we developed some preliminary diagnostics to evaluate how the model’s posterior components affect key parameters of interest. For example, it is useful to know the relative impact of the 2018 year-class on the next year’s spawning biomass (<a href="#fig-ssb_v_2018" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;52</a>). <!-- Additionally, what different --> <!-- components (in negative log-likelihood terms) conflict or interact with --> <!-- such a critical parameter (@fig-post_profile). --></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sensitivity-to-model-specification">Sensitivity to model specification</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://afsc-assessments.github.io/ebs_pollock_safe/doc/sept.html">September 2024 assessment evaluation</a> a detailed set of sensitivities were presented regarding assumptions about the stock-recruitment relationship (SRR), an alternative natural mortality-at-age and year matrix (from the CEATTLE model results),</p>
<p>A sequential sensitivity of available new data showed that adding the new data from 2024 had very minor changes and impact on the spawning biomass estimates (<a href="#fig-mod_data" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;32</a>; top panel). The largest effect on all the changes arose from the revision to the mean body weight-at-age used for the spawning biomass calculations (<a href="#fig-mod_data" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;32</a>; bottom panel). This was shown in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2023">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>. Nonetheless, diagnostics of all the changes relative to model fits are given in and a comparison of management quantities for the final base model is given in ).</p>
<p>In the 2020 assessment, SRR evaluations related to Tier 1 classification showed that dropping the influence of the 1978 year-class in the estimation lowered the steepness of the curve and that when the influence of the prior distribution was removed the residual pattern for estimates near the origin was particularly bad (all below the curve). From those results we conclude that the prior specification was appropriate because we place priority on fitting estimated recruits near the slope at the origin better. In the 2021 assessment we showed that conditioning the SRR to fit the condition of having the “actual” <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> equal some <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> proxies (e.g., equal <span class="math inline">\(F_{35\%}\)</span>) resulted in more conservative ABCs due to shallower initial slopes. A conclusion from these exercises was that the SPR proxy for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> implies a reasonable “shape” to the SRR.</p>
<p>The fit to the early Japanese fishery CPUE data (Low and Ikeda 1980) was consistent with the estimated population trends for this period (<a href="#fig-mod_cpue_fit" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;33</a>). The model fits the fishery-independent index from the 2006–2023 AVO data well through most of the period but the model predicts lower biomass than the index data indicate in 2023 (<a href="#fig-mod_avo_fit" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;34</a>). The model fits to the bottom-trawl survey biomass (the density-dependent corrected series) were reasonable and within the observation error bounds (<a href="#fig-mod_bts_biom" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;35</a>). The model fit to the BTS biomass index predicts fewer pollock than observed in the 2014 and 2015 survey but then varied in subsequent years (<a href="#fig-mod_bts_biom" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;35</a>). The fit to the acoustic-trawl survey biomass series (including the USV data from 2020) was consistent with the specified observation uncertainty (<a href="#fig-mod_ats_biom" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;36</a>).</p>

<p>Near term stock projection magnitude depends largely on the estimate of the 2018 year class. As such we profiled model fits for 33 fixed values of that year-class and examined the negative log-likelihood components (<a href="#fig-like_profile" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;46</a>). Most of the data components were consistent with global estimate of the 2018 year-class.</p>
</section>
<section id="retrospective-analysis-within-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retrospective-analysis-within-model">Retrospective analysis (within model)</h3>
<p>We ran a twenty-year retrospective analysis by sequential removal of all data annually beginning with 2024 and ending in 2005 (<a href="#fig-mod_retro" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;53</a>). While variable, the confidence bounds of the retrospective patterns overlapped in all years reflecting the general model uncertainty rather than a consistent retrospective pattern. In 2023, the lower than expected survey biomass estimate followed by an increase this year, the retrospective pattern degraded with an average bias (Mohns <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> equal to 1300 for the 10 year retrospective).</p>
<p>For the recruitment side, the retrospective pattern shows two key results. First, the 2018 year-class (age 1 recruits in 2019) shows up as a big estimate just this year (<a href="#fig-mod_retroR" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;54</a>). Second, the retrospective pattern shows how an equally abundant year-class occurred from the 2012 year-class for three years (with data terminating in 2016, 2017, and 2018). Then, in 2019 and in subsequent years that estimate dropped by over 10% and became the 2012 and the 2013 year-class. In the 2022 assessment we adjusted the value downwards to be equal to the mean of some earlier year classes. This year, we simply accepted the estimate for projections given a better confirmation on the magnitude of the 2018 year class.</p>
<p>Related to this issue of consistency in year-class estimation, and in response to an SSC request, we evaluated how the influence of additional years of data affected year-class estimates. <a href="#fig-retrocohtyr" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;55</a> and <a href="#fig-retrocoh" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;56</a> illustrate how year-class estimates can vary for retrospective analyses. These figures show some of the change in relative abundance between the 2012 and 2013 year-classes and how the 2008 year estimate dissipated some as more data became available.</p>
<p>In response to previous SSC requests to evaluate how selectivity is used for ABC and catch advice, we used the retrospective runs to show how the “projected” selectivity compared with subsequent estimates which had the benefit of more data (<a href="#fig-retro_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;57</a>). To explain this figure, and taking the 2023 panel as an example, the blue line in that panel represents the projected estimate from the 2022 “peel” (the current model projecting to 2023 using only data up until 2022). The dots represent estimates from each “peel” and the dots in the 2022 panel are based on this year’s estimated selectivity. In general, the projected selectivity conformed reasonably well with subsequent estimates. To further summarize these results, we also computed a summary statistic as the mean age of selection (independent of any age-specific stock size):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bar a =\frac{\sum{S_a a}}{\sum{S_a}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(S_a\)</span> is the selectivity at age (ages 1 to 11). This statistic showed that recently the projection was biased towards younger pollock but earlier on, the bias was toward older fish (<a href="#fig-retro_sel_mnage" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;58</a>).</p>
<p>Since selectivity varies over time, and the fact that fishing mortality rates for management advice depend on the assumed future selectivity, we evaluate the pattern of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> rates given different selectivity assumptions (i.e., <a href="#fig-mod_fsh_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;38</a>). In the 2020 and 2021 assessment, because of the indications of small pollock being unusually present in the fishery, we chose a selectivity pattern from history that reflected tendency towards younger fish (specifically, that from 2005). Using the statistic on mean selected age, we found that the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> showed a correlation (<a href="#fig-fmsy_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;59</a>). This figure reveals how shifts in the relative age of fish selected impact <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> estimates.</p>

<section id="time-series-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-series-results">Time series results</h2>
<p>The time series of begin-year biomass estimates (ages 3 and older) suggests that the abundance of Eastern Bering Sea pollock remained at a high level from 1982–88, with estimates ranging from 8 to 12 million t (). Historically, biomass levels increased from 1979 to the mid-1980s due to the strong 1978 and relatively strong 1982 and 1984 year classes recruiting to the fishable population. The stock is characterized by peaks in the mid-1980s, the mid-1990s and again appears to be increasing to a peak of more than 12 million t in 2016 following the low in 2008 of 4.35 million t. The estimate for 2024 is trending downward and at 9.41 million t with 2025 estimated at 8.53 million t.</p>
<p>The level of fishing relative to biomass estimates shows that the spawning exploitation rate (SER, defined as the percent removal of egg production in each spawning year) has been mostly below 20% since 1980 (<a href="#fig-mod_ser" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;60</a>). During 2006 and 2007 the rate averaged more than 20% and the average fishing mortality increased during the period of stock decline. The estimate for 2009 through 2018 was below 20% due to the reductions in TACs relative to the maximum permissible ABC values and increases in the spawning biomass. The fishing mortality has fluctuated since 2010-2015 but, unlike last year’s upward trend, the improved spawning biomass condition has held this rate tending toward lower levels. Age specific fishing mortality rates reflect these patterns and show some increases in the oldest ages from 2011–2013 but relatively stable (<a href="#fig-mod_F" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;61</a>). The estimates of age 3+ pollock biomass showed a large drop last year compared to several of the earlier years but this has reversed in the current assessment (<a href="#fig-mod_hist" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;62</a>, ).</p>
<p>Estimated numbers-at-age are presented in () and estimated catch-at-age values are presented in (). Estimated summary biomass (age 3+), female spawning biomass, and age-1 recruitment are given in ().</p>
<p>To evaluate past management and assessment performance it can be useful to examine estimated fishing mortality relative to reference values. For EBS pollock, we computed the reference fishing mortality from Tier 1 (unadjusted) and recalculated the historical values for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> (since selectivity has changed over time). Since 1977 the current estimates of fishing mortality suggest that during the early period, harvest rates were above <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> until about 1980. Since that time, the levels of fishing mortality have averaged about 35% of the <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> level (<a href="#fig-mod_phase" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;63</a>). Projections of spawning stock biomass given the 2025 estimate of fishing mortality rate given catches equal to the 2024 values shows a decline through 2021 and then an increase after; albeit with considerable uncertainty due to uncertainty in recruitment (<a href="#fig-proj_ssb" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;64</a>).</p>
<section id="recruitment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recruitment">Recruitment</h3>
<p>Model estimates indicate that the 2008, 2012, 2013, and now the 2018 year classes are above average (<a href="#fig-mod_rec" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;65</a>). The 2018 year class is nearly 4 times bigger than average with a CV of about 16%. The stock-recruitment curve as fit within the integrated model shows the variability of the estimated curve (<a href="#fig-mod_srr" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;66</a>). Note that the 2021 and 2022 year classes (as age 1 recruits in 2022 and 2023) were excluded from the stock-recruitment curve estimation as per convention and guidance from NPFMC. Separate from fitting the stock-recruit relationship within the model, examining the estimated recruits-per-spawning biomass shows variability over time but seems to lack trend and also is consistent with the Ricker stock- recruit relationship used within the model (<a href="#fig-mod_rs" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;67</a>).</p>
<p>Environmental factors affecting recruitment are considered important and contribute to the variability. Previous studies linked strong Bering Sea pollock recruitment to years with warm sea temperatures and northward transport of pollock eggs and larvae (<span class="citation" data-cites="wespestad2000">Wespestad et al. (<a href="#ref-wespestad2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="mueter2006">Mueter et al. (<a href="#ref-mueter2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>). As part of the Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Survey (BASIS) project research has also been directed toward the relative density and quality (in terms of condition for survival) of young-of-year pollock. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="moss2009">Moss et al. (<a href="#ref-moss2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> found age-0 pollock were very abundant and widely distributed to the north and east on the Bering Sea shelf during 2004 and 2005 (warm sea temperature; high water column stratification) indicating high northern transport of pollock eggs and larvae during those years. <span class="citation" data-cites="mueter2011">Mueter et al. (<a href="#ref-mueter2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> found that warmer conditions tended to result in lower pollock recruitment in the EBS. This is consistent with the hypothesis that when sea temperatures on the eastern Bering Sea shelf are warm and the water column is highly stratified during summer, age-0 pollock appear to allocate more energy to growth than to lipid storage (presumably due to a higher metabolic rate), leading to low energy density prior to winter. This then may result in increased over-winter mortality (<span class="citation" data-cites="swartzman2005">Swartzman et al. (<a href="#ref-swartzman2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="winter2005">Winter et al. (<a href="#ref-winter2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2011">Ianelli et al. (<a href="#ref-ianelli2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>) evaluated the consequences of current harvest policies in the face of warmer conditions with the link to potentially lower pollock recruitment and noted that the current management system is likely to face higher chances of ABCs below the historical average catches. Also, as part of the evaluation of stationarity given periods of “regimes”, we revisited estimated mean recruitment during different periods previously identified as being unique (<a href="#fig-mod_regimes" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;68</a>). This shows that given the revised estimate of the 2018 year class, the impact of the recent warm conditions suggest that the recent period (2000-present) is similar to the mean since 1977.</p>

We report the “standard” Tier 2 ABC calculation using the point estimate (the mean of the posterior distribution) of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span>. Therefore, for 2025 the Tier 2a ABC would be 2,831,000 t. Since we have estimates of the harmonic mean (from Tier 1 calculations) an alternative Tier 2 estimate using that in place of the arithmetic mean <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> results in an ABC of 2,448,000 t.</p>
<p>In summary, the criterion for Tier 1 depends on a reliable estimate of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> and the uncertainty (the PDF). Tier 2 also requires a reliable estimate of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> (without the PDF requirement). Given the seemingly reasonable posterior marginal density for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span>, it seems if Tier 1 criterion is unmet, then so would the requirement for Tier 2. Given the priors assumed for the SRR, and the fact that the results are largely similar to the Tier 3 proxy for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> (i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(F_{SPR\%}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> is close to <span class="math inline">\(F_{35\%}\)</span>), <strong>we recommend adopting Tier 3 for this stock until a more detailed management strategy evaluation can be pursued</strong>. As noted below in the section on risk evaluations, there are reasons for increased concerns. However, these seem to be unrelated to overall stock productivity as relates to the SRR and estimates of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="amendment-56-reference-points">Amendment 56 Reference Points</h2>
<p>Amendment 56 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) defines overfishing level (OFL), the fishing mortality rate used to set OFL (FOFL), the maximum permissible ABC, and the fishing mortality rate used to set the maximum permissible ABC. The fishing mortality rate used to set ABC (<span class="math inline">\(F_{ABC}\)</span>) may be less than this maximum permissible level, but not greater. Estimates of reference points related to maximum sustainable yield (MSY) are currently available. However, we present both reference points for pollock in the BSAI to retain the option for consideration of either Tier 1, 2, or Tier 3 values from the harvest control rules provided in Amendment 56. These Tiers require reference point estimates for biomass level determinations. Consistent with other groundfish stocks, the following values are based on recruitment estimates from post-1976 spawning events (recognizing the the 1978 year class is excluded from the MSY calculations but included in the SPR calculations):</p>

As such, the harmonic mean value of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> —here computed as an exploitation rate—is applied to the fishable biomass for computing ABC levels. For details on the risk-averse properties of this approach see Thompson (1996). For a future year, the fishable biomass is defined as the sum over ages of predicted begin-year numbers multiplied by age specific fishery selectivity and estimated mean body mass-at-age. The uncertainty in the average weights-at-age projected for the fishery and “future selectivity” has been demonstrated to affect the buffer between ABC and OFL (computed as 1-ABC/OFL) for Tier 1 maximum permissible ABC (<span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2015">Ianelli et al. (<a href="#ref-ianelli2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>). The uncertainty in future mean weights-at-age had a relatively large impact as did the selectivity estimation (see the section above on retrospective behavior and <a href="#fig-fmsy_sel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;59</a>).</p>
<p>Since the 2025 female spawning biomass is estimated to be above the <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> level (2,318 kt) and above the <span class="math inline">\(B_{40\%}\)</span> value (2,361 kt) in 2025 and if the 2024 catch is as specified above, then the OFL and maximum permissible ABC values by the different Tier categorizations would be:</p>

<section id="standard-harvest-scenarios-and-projection-methodology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standard-harvest-scenarios-and-projection-methodology">Standard Harvest Scenarios and Projection Methodology</h2>
<p>A standard set of projections is required for each stock managed under Tiers 1, 2, or 3 of Amendment 56 to the FMP. This set of projections encompasses seven harvest scenarios designed to satisfy the requirements of Amendment 56, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA). While EBS pollock is generally considered to fall within Tier 1, the standard projection model requires knowledge of future uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span>. Since this would require a number of additional assumptions that presume future knowledge about stock-recruit uncertainty, the projections in this subsection are based on Tier 3.</p>
<p>For each scenario, the projections begin with the vector of 2024 numbers at age estimated in the assessment. This vector is then projected forward to the beginning of 2025 using the schedules of natural mortality and selectivity described in the assessment and the best available estimate of total (year-end) catch assumed for 2024. In each subsequent year, the fishing mortality rate is prescribed on the basis of the spawning biomass in that year and the respective harvest scenario. Annual recruits are simulated from an inverse Gaussian distribution whose parameters consist of maximum likelihood estimates determined from the estimated age-1 recruits. Spawning biomass is computed in each year based on the time of peak spawning and the maturity and weight schedules described in the assessment. Total catch is assumed to equal the catch associated with the respective harvest scenario in all years. This projection scheme is run 1,000 times to obtain distributions of possible future stock sizes and catches under alternative fishing mortality rate scenarios.</p>
<p>Five of the seven standard scenarios support the alternative harvest strategies analyzed in the Alaska Groundfish Harvest Specifications Final Environmental Impact Statement. These five scenarios, which are designed to provide a range of harvest alternatives that are likely to bracket the final TAC for 2025, are as follows (“<span class="math inline">\(maxFABC\)</span>” refers to the maximum permissible value of FABC under Amendment 56):</p>
<p>The latter two scenarios are needed to satisfy the MSFCMA’s requirement to determine whether a stock is currently in an overfished condition or is approaching an overfished condition (for Tier 3 stocks, the MSY level is defined as <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>).</p>
</section>
<section id="projections-and-status-determination" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="projections-and-status-determination">Projections and status determination</h2>
<p>For the purposes of these projections, we present results based on selecting the <span class="math inline">\(F_{40\%}\)</span> harvest rate as the <span class="math inline">\(F_{ABC}\)</span> value and use <span class="math inline">\(F_{35\%}\)</span> as a proxy for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span>. Scenarios 1 through 7 were projected 14 years from 2024 ( for Model 23.0–including the 1978 year-class as is convention for Tier 3 estimates). Under catches set to Tier 3 ABC estimates, the expected spawning biomass is well above <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span> and is expected to be drop below <span class="math inline">\(B_{40\%}\)</span> by 2026 (given mean recruitment; <a href="#fig-tier3_proj" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;69</a> and assuming catches &gt;2 million t in 2025).</p>
<p>Any stock that is below its minimum stock size threshold (MSST) is defined to be overfished. Any stock that is expected to fall below its MSST in the next two years is defined to be approaching an overfished condition. Harvest scenarios 6 and 7 are used in these determinations as follows:</p>
<p>Is the stock overfished? This depends on the stock’s estimated spawning biomass in 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If spawning biomass for 2024 is estimated to be below 1/2 <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span> the stock is below its MSST.</p></li>
<li><p>If spawning biomass for 2024 is estimated to be above <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the stock is above its MSST.</p></li>
<li><p>If spawning biomass for 2024 is estimated to be above 1/2 <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span> but below <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the stock’s status relative to MSST is determined by referring to harvest scenario 6 ( through ). If the mean spawning biomass for 2034 is below <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the stock is below its MSST. Otherwise, the stock is above its MSST.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Is the stock approaching an overfished condition? This is determined by referring to harvest Scenario 7:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the mean spawning biomass for 2024 is below 1/2 <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the stock is approaching an overfished condition.</p></li>
<li><p>If the mean spawning biomass for 2024 is above <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the stock is not approaching an overfished condition.</p></li>
<li><p>If the mean spawning biomass for 2026 is above 1/2 <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span> but below <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the determination depends on the mean spawning biomass for 2036. If the mean spawning biomass for 2036 is below <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>, the stock is approaching an overfished condition. Otherwise, the stock is not approaching an overfished condition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For scenarios 6 and 7, we conclude that pollock is above MSST for the year 2024, and it is expected to be above the “overfished condition” based on Scenario 7 (the mean spawning biomass in 2024 is between the 1/2 <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span> estimate but by 2036 the stock is above <span class="math inline">\(B_{35\%}\)</span>; (). Based on this, the EBS pollock stock is being fished below the overfishing level and is not approaching an overfished condition.</p>
<p>To fulfill reporting requirements for <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/species-information-system">NOAA’s Species Information System</a>, we computed the average fishing mortality rate corresponding to the specified OFL for the last complete year (2023). This hypothetical 2023 <span class="math inline">\(F_{OFL}\)</span> from this year’s model was estimated to be XXX0.262XXX for EBS pollock (assuming this year’s estimated 2023 selectivity and weight-at-age).</p>

<section id="abc-recommendation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abc-recommendation">ABC Recommendation</h2>
<p>ABC levels are affected by estimates of <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> which depend principally on the estimated stock-recruitment steepness parameter, demographic schedules such as selectivity-at-age, maturity, and growth. The current stock size (both spawning and fishable) is estimated to be above average levels and projections indicate the potential for further declines. Updated data and analysis result in an estimate of 2024 spawning biomass (3,390 kt) which is about 146% of <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> (2,318 kt). This follows a short period of decline from 2017-2020 followed by a previously unexpected increase due to revised estimates of the 2018 year class. Treating all new data the same way as in the past, this estimate suggests that it would be the biggest year-class on record (81,100 age 1 numbers), but with considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p><span style="border-radius: 0.2rem; padding: 0 0.2rem 0 0.2rem;background-color: #FFFF00;">xxGiven the same estimated aggregate fishing effort as in 2024 and given</span> the estimated stock trend, the constant-F scenario would yield about 1.3 million t.

<section id="assessment-considerations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assessment-considerations">Assessment considerations</h4>
<p>The EBS pollock assessment model has appeared to track the stock from year-to-year based on retrospective analysis in previous assessments. In 2024 two surveys showed decreases from the previous estimates (the ATS and AVO indices). The BTS index showed a substantive increase from 2023 estimate. For the three new age-composition estimates available this year, they all indicated persistence in the 2018 year class. While the stock trends and age composition seems to be robustly estimated, we note that in the analyses presented in Sept 2024 (<span class="citation" data-cites="ianellisept">Ianelli and McGilliard (<a href="#ref-ianellisept" role="doc-biblioref">2024a</a>)</span>), the robustness of stock-productivity estimates was questioned, especially for the stock-recruitment relationship. <strong>Therefore we rated the assessment-related concern as Level 2, Major concern (if Tier 1), Level 1, no concern (if Tier 3).</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="population-dynamics-considerations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="population-dynamics-considerations">Population dynamics considerations</h4>
<p>The age structure of EBS pollock has exhibited some peculiarities over time. On the positive side, some strong year-classes appear to have increased in abundance based on the bottom-trawl survey data (e.g., the 1992, 2012, 2013 and 2018 year classes). Conversely, the period from 2000–2007 had relatively poor year-class strengths which resulted in declines in stock below <span class="math inline">\({B_{msy}}\)</span> and reduced TACs due to lower ABC values. Given new support for the strong year-class strength from 2018, it appears that the mean recruitment since 2000 has been nearly average but with greater variability than earlier years (<a href="#fig-mod_regimes" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;68</a>). The stock is estimated to be above <span class="math inline">\({B_{msy}}\)</span> at present, and projections indicate a increases given recent catch levels. Recruitment in the near term is about average and highly uncertain. Additional age-specific aspects of the spawning population indicate that the stock has increased from a low diversity of ages (for both the population and the mean age of the spawning stock weighted by spawning output <a href="#fig-age_diversity" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;71</a>). <strong>We therefore rated the population-dynamics concern as level 1, No Concern</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary for Environmental/Ecosystem considerations</strong> The following summarizes “Environmental/Ecosystem” considerations (see <a href="#sec-ecorisk" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;15</a> for details):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environment:</strong> The EBS shelf experienced oceanographic conditions that were largely average based on historical time series of multiple metrics over the past year (August 2023 - August 2024).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prey:</strong> Trends of prey for pollock were mostly low in 2024, with prey conditions over the SEBS shelf being potentially more limiting while prey conditions over the NBS shelf appear limiting for age-0 and juvenile pollock, but sufficient for adult fish. The spatial distribution of adult pollock appears to have overlapped with large ‘oceanic’ copepods, while rates of cannibalism indicate reduced overlap with juvenile pollock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competitors</strong>: Trends in potential competitors were mixed over the shelf, with pollock representing the greatest increase in biomass and potential competitive pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predators</strong>: Trends in potential predators increased over the shelf, though spatial mismatch may mitigate realized predation pressure. Rates of cannibalism remained low in 2024.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, the most recent data available suggest an ecosystem risk Level 1 – Normal: <em>“No apparent ecosystem concerns related to biological status (e.g., environment, prey, competition, predation), or minor concerns with uncertain impacts on the stock.”</em></p>

<section id="fishery-performance" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fishery-performance">Fishery performance</h4>
<p>As noted above, the 2024 fishery again experienced good nominal fishing rates though dropped slightly from the 2023 indicator. The 2024 fishery xxxseemed to have generally smaller-than-expected pollock in the fishery and there was indications that the fish were unusually skinny given their length. The fleet dispersion (the relative distance or spread of the fishery in space) as shown in the past has indicated that the seasonal dispersion levels increased slightly but was still relatively low (indicating relatively good fishing; <a href="#fig-fleet_dispersal" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9</a>).</p>
<p>The CPUE of PSC species and other bycatch declined in 2024. Sablefish, herring and Chinook salmon bycatch rates (per hour of fishing) continued to decrease from 2021 (except for a slight increase in herring CPUE during the B season from low levels; <a href="#fig-fsh_psc_cpue" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>).</p>
<p>The way the ABC control rule interacts with actual fishing is worth considering. Specifically, given the 2 million t OY cap for all of groundfish, when the EBS pollock stock is above target levels, the fishing effort is lower (a lower <em>F</em>). As it approaches the target (<span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span>), it increases and then when it drops below, the fishing mortality rate is ratcheted downwards rapidly. This can be exacerbated when there are sudden unanticipated changes in survey estimates (like what was apparently the case in 2021 which caused the retrospective pattern to degrade). The mean weight-at-age for the 2021 B-season was near average, but in general, pollock were skinny given their length. However, concerns over the amount of 2-year old pollock in the 2020 fishery data has been ameliorated with continued positive signs of that year-class which is projected to be an abundant number of 5-year olds in 2023. For this reason, we <strong>conclude that that the fishery performance warrants a score of 1, No Concern.</strong></p>
<p>These results are summarized as:</p>
<p>We generally strive to present two key types of information within a fisheries stock assessment. First, we compile all available fishery dependent and fishery independent data to evaluate trends in stock biomass and abundance. Second, we attempt to provide stock productivity estimates. For the latter, age-specific biological data are used to estimate growth, mortality, and reproductive potential. Such information provides guidelines to avoid growth overfishing. An added productivity estimate, that following estimates of the stock recruitment relationship (SRR), can contribute to advice that avoids so called “recruitment” overfishing. This latter point is a key contrast that distinguishes Tiers 1 and 2 within our FMP system from Tier 3 stock classifications.</p>
<p>In the past, the SSC has considered factors similar to those presented above and selected an ABC based on Tier 3 estimates. Last year the SSC requested examining Tier 2 values as an alternative. Unlike Tier 3, using Tier 2 would have a constant buffer relative to the Tier 1 value (at about 11%). Setting the ABC to Tier 3 levels provides a very large buffer but one that could be warranted given that the impact on subsequent spawning biomass levels will be much more variable and have a high probability of dropping below the target stock size and result in much reduced future ABCs under the current FMP. It is worth noting that fishing at the full Tier 1 ABC would imply a more than doubling of effort and well exceed the 2 million t groundfish catch limit. Even fishing at a full Tier 3 ABC shows there is a relatively high probability of falling below <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> values or proxies thereof. Under our standard scenarios, Alternative 3 shows trajectories if fishing effort is held equal to the recent 5-year average. It is noteworthy that this provides stock sizes that have a good probability of being above targets and avoiding drastic reductions in yeild (lower overall variability in ABC/yields; <a href="#fig-tier3_proj_alt3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;70</a>).</p>
<p>The SSC has requested “an explicit set of concerns that explain the ABC adjustment.” In response, we direct attention to the decision table () and the fact that the biological basis for the continued stock productivity has most to do with the OY constraint which has effectively maintained fishery production at around 1.3 million t since 1990. Demonstrations that would allow fishing to near <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> catch quantities would show that catch variability would be extremely high (and unrealistic given current capacity and OY limits for combined BSAI groundfish; <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2005">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). Furthermore, the frequency of being at much lower spawning stock sizes would be much higher, and would likely be riskier and fishing effort would need to be much higher. While the biological basis for ABC setting is founded in sound conservation of spawning biomass, the history of the current fishery productivity should inform desirable biomass. In only 6 of the 41 years since 1981 has the stock been below the <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> level (15% of the years). The mean spawning biomass over this period has averaged about 18% higher than the estimated <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span>. In terms of an actual “management target”, Punt et al.&nbsp;(2013) developed some robust estimators for <span class="math inline">\(B_{MEY}\)</span> (Maximum Economic Yield) noting that a typical target would be 1.2<span class="math inline">\(\times B_{MSY}\)</span> or about -2% lower than the mean value or a target female spawning biomass at 2.781 million t. It therefore seems worth considering developing an explicit harvest control rule that achieves the level of productivity observed over the past 30 years.</p>
<p>In recent years when the pollock biomass was estimated to be well above average, the catch was constrained by other factors. Specifically, the 2 million t BSAI groundfish catch limit and bycatch avoidance measures has an impact on the potential for large increases in catch. As the stock is presently estimated to be below <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span>, the maximum permissible ABC under the FMP can become the limiting factor for TAC specification. Unfortunately, this ABC can ratchet down quickly because as the stock declines further below this target stock size, the ABC fishing mortality rate is adjusted downwards nearly proportionately. This part of the FMP control rule can create high variability in the TAC. Less variability in the catch, accordingly, would also result in less spawning stock variability and reduce risks to the fishery should the period of poor recruitment continue.</p>
<p>To more fully evaluate these considerations performance indicators as modified from Ianelli et al.&nbsp;(2012) were developed to evaluate some near-term risks given alternative 2025 catch values. These indicators and rationale for including them are summarized in ). Model 23 (the “base”) results for these indicators are provided in . Each column of this table uses a fixed 2025 catch and assumes the same effort for the four additional projection years (2026–2029). Given this specification, there is a low probability that any of the catches shown in the first row would exceed the <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> level. Also, in the near term it appears unlikely that the spawning stock will be below <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> (rows 3 and 4). Relative to the historical mean spawning biomass, by 2025 it is more likely than not that the spawning biomass will be lower than the historical mean (fifth row). The range of catches examined have relatively small or no impact on the age diversity indicators. The table indicates that for the 2024 catch to equal the 2023 value, about the same level of fishing effort would be required. In terms of catch advice, the results presented in the decision table indicates that catches above 1.3 million t will very likely result in 2026 spawning stock estimates being below the long term mean (but above <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span>).</p>
<p>In the past, another approach/rationale for stabilizing effort by setting the fishing mortality equal to the current year. Doing so this year suggests setting the fishing mortality to 2024 levels results in a catch of 1,150,000 t. Given the revisions to last year’s model results and the positive increases in stock size, maintaining a constant fishing mortality rate seems unnecessary at this time.</p>

<h1>Additional ecosystem considerations</h1>
<p>In general, a number of key issues for ecosystem conservation and management can be highlighted. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preventing overfishing;</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding habitat degradation;</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing incidental bycatch;</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring bycatch and the level of discards; and</p></li>
<li><p>Considering multi-species trophic interactions relative to harvest policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the case of pollock in the Eastern Bering Sea, the NPFMC and NMFS continue to manage the fishery on the basis of these issues in addition to the single- species harvest approach (Hollowed et al.&nbsp;2011). The prevention of overfishing is clearly set out as the main guideline for management. Habitat degradation has been minimized in the pollock fishery by converting the industry to pelagic-gear only. Bycatch in the pollock fleet is closely monitored by the NMFS observer program and managed on that basis. Discard rates of many species have been reduced in this fishery and efforts to minimize bycatch continue.</p>
<p>In comparisons of the Western Bering Sea (WBS) with the Eastern Bering Sea using mass-balance food-web models based on 1980–85 summer diet data, <span class="citation" data-cites="aydin2002">Aydin et al. (<a href="#ref-aydin2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> found that the production in these two systems is quite different. On a per-unit-area measure, the western Bering Sea has higher productivity than the EBS. Also, the pathways of this productivity are different with much of the energy flowing through epifaunal species (e.g., sea urchins and brittlestars) in the WBS whereas for the EBS, crab and flatfish species play a similar role. In both regions, the keystone species in 1980–85 were pollock and Pacific cod. This study showed that the food web estimated for the EBS ecosystem appears to be relatively mature due to the large number of interconnections among species. In a more recent study based on 1990–93 diet data, pollock remain in a central role in the ecosystem. The diet of pollock is similar between adults and juveniles with the exception that adults become more piscivorous (with consumption of pollock by adult pollock representing their third largest prey item).</p>
<p>Regarding specific small-scale ecosystems of the EBS, Ciannelli et al. (2004a, 2004b) presented an application of an ecosystem model scaled to data available around the Pribilof Islands region. They applied bioenergetics and foraging theory to characterize the spatial extent of this ecosystem. They compared energy balance, from a food web model relevant to the foraging range of northern fur seals and found that a range of 100 nautical mile radius encloses the area of highest energy balance representing about 50% of the observed foraging range for lactating fur seals. This has led to a hypothesis that fur seals depend on areas outside the energetic balance region. This study develops a method for evaluating the shape and extent of a key ecosystem in the EBS (i.e., the Pribilof Islands). Furthermore, the overlap of the pollock fishery and northern fur seal foraging habitat has been identified (see <span class="citation" data-cites="sterling2004">Sterling and Ream (<a href="#ref-sterling2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="zeppelin2006">Zeppelin and Ream (<a href="#ref-zeppelin2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>A brief summary of these two perspectives (ecosystem effects on pollock stock and pollock fishery effects on ecosystem) is given in (). Unlike the food-web models discussed above, examining predators and prey in isolation may overly simplify relationships. This table serves to highlight the main connections and the status of our understanding or lack thereof.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ecosystem-effects-on-the-ebs-pollock-stock-and-fishery-effects-on-the-ecosystem.">Ecosystem effects on the EBS pollock stock and fishery effects on the ecosystem.</h2>
<p>These two topics are combined here noting that the presentation in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2023">Ianelli (<a href="#ref-ianelli2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> is unchanged and updated summary of current conditions is provided in an appendix. Relative to habitat, <span class="citation" data-cites="hollowed2012">Hollowed et al. (<a href="#ref-hollowed2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> provided an extensive review of habitat and density for age-0 and age-1 pollock based on survey data. A separate section presented again this year updates a multispecies model with more recent data and is presented as a supplement to the BSAI SAFE report. This approach incorporates a number of simplifications for the individual species data and fisheries processes (e.g., constant fishery selectivity and the use of design-based survey indices for biomass). However, that model mimics the biomass levels and trends with the single species reasonably well. It also allows specific questions to be addressed regarding pollock TACs. For example, since predation (and cannibalism) is explicitly modeled, the impact of relative stock sizes on subsequent recruitment to the fishery can be now be directly estimated and evaluated (in the model presented here, cannibalism is explicitly accounted for in the assumed Ricker stock-recruit relationship).</p>
<p>xxxSince the pollock fishery is primarily pelagic in nature, the bycatch of non- target species is small relative to the magnitude of the fishery (). Jellyfish represent the largest component of the bycatch of non-target species and had averaged around 5–6 kt per year but more than doubled in 2014, then dropping again in 2015. The 2018 value was high, dropped and then was again high in 2021. The data on non-target species shows a high degree of inter-annual variability, which reflects the spatial variability of the fishery and high observation error. This variability may reduce the ability to detect significant trends for bycatch species.</p>
<p>The catch of other target species in the pollock fishery (defined as any trawl set where the catch represents more than 80% of the catch) represents about 1% of the total pollock catch. Incidental catch of Pacific cod has varied but after a period of low catch levels it increased to over 9,000 t in 2020 and 2021 but in 2022 was under 4 thousand t (). There has been a marked increase in the incidental catch of Pacific ocean perch in the since 2014 with a peak just under 8 thousand t in 2019. The incidental catch of sablefish peaked in 2020 at about 3.5 thousand t but was less that 300 t in 2022. The incidental catch of pollock in other target fisheries is more than double the bycatch of target species in the pollock fishery with the largest pollock catches in the yellofin sole and Pacific cod fisheries ().</p>
<p>The number of non-Chinook salmon (nearly all made up of chum salmon) taken incidentally varies considerably over time. The bycatch increased since 2014 with the 2017 number in excess of 465 thousand fish, the third highest non-Chinook salmon bycatch that’s been observed since 1991. Since then, 7 of the top 10 highest bycatch years have occurred with nearly 550 thousand taken in 2021 (). Chinook salmon bycatch has varied (42% CV since 2011) and averaged just under 19 thousand fish from 2011-2023 (). After a recent high bycatch of over 32,000 fish in 2020, the 2022 and 2023 bycatch was 6,415 and 11,750 Chinook salmon, respectively. <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2014">Ianelli and Stram (<a href="#ref-ianelli2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> provided estimates of the bycatch impact on Chinook salmon runs to the coastal west Alaska region and found that the peak bycatch levels exceeded 7% of the total run return. Since 2011, the impact has been estimated to be below 2%. Updated estimates given new genetic information and these levels of PSC as provided to the Council continue to suggest that the impact is low.</p>

<h1>Data gaps and research priorities</h1>
<p>We note that in early 2025, the AFSC has applied for a review of the EBS pollock assessment by the “Center for Independent Experts” <span class="citation" data-cites="cie">NOAA Fisheries (<a href="#ref-cie" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The available data for EBS pollock are extensive yet many processes behind the observed patterns continue to be poorly understood. The recent patterns of abundance observed in the northern Bering Sea provide an example. As such, we recommend the following research priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support developing a team of analysts to evaluate all aspects of the current model against alternatives (e.g., Rceattle, WHAM, Stock Synthesis, etc.). <em>This work has progressed and presently, developments on the Gulf of Alaska assessment adopting WHAM appears promising.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Continue to investigate using spatial processes for estimation purposes (e.g., combining acoustic and bottom trawl survey data). The application of the geostatistical methods seems like a reasonable approach to statistically model disparate data sources for generating better abundance indices. Also, examine the potential to use pelagic samples from the BASIS survey to inform recruitment and subsequent spatial patterns. <em>Work on developing data from the BASIS survey to inform recruitment has not been pursued. The work to refine the AVO data has helped with information used in this assessment.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Develop methods to use spatio-temporal models to estimate composition information (specifically, weight-at-age in the survey). <em>Two papers, (<span class="citation" data-cites="indivero2023">Indivero et al. (<a href="#ref-indivero2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>) and (<span class="citation" data-cites="cheng2023">Cheng et al. (<a href="#ref-cheng2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>) have been published targeting this type of activity. The former is presently used in this assessment while the latter has yet to be applied.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Study the relationship between climate and recruitment and trophic interactions of pollock within the ecosystem. This would be useful for improving ways to evaluate the current and alternative fishery management systems. In particular, a careful re-evaluation of the current FMP harvest control rule should be undertaken. <em>As part of the ACLIM program, progress is being made. However, a full evaluation of the FMP control rules is pending.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Apply new technologies (e.g., bottom-moored echosounders) to evaluate pollock movement between regions and supplement this work with analytical approaches. <em>The data have been processed completely and a manuscript is being submitted. Next steps is to use this information to develop scenarios for flux over the maritime boundary and evaluate relative fishing effort impacts on either side.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Expand genetic sample collections for pollock (and process available samples) and apply high resolution genetic tools for stock structure analyses. <em>Additional analyses have been completed and are expected to lead to a publication in 2024.</em></p></li>
</ul>

\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where</p>
<p>Fishing mortality (<span class="math inline">\(F_{t,a}\)</span>) is specified as being semi-separable and non-parametric in form with restrictions on the variability following <span class="citation" data-cites="butterworth2003ajms">Butterworth et al.

\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(s_{t,a}\)</span> is the selectivity for age class <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu^f\)</span> is the median fishing mortality rate over time.</p>
<p>If the selectivities (<span class="math inline">\(s_{t,a}\)</span>) are constant over time then fishing mortality rate decomposes into an age component and a year component. A curvature penalty on the selectivity coefficients using the squared second-differences to provide smoothness between ages.</p>
<p>Bottom-trawl survey selectivity was set to be asymptotic yet retain the properties desired for the characteristics of this gear. Namely, that the function should allow flexibility in selecting age 1 pollock over time. The functional form of this selectivity was:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    s_{t,a}     &amp;= \left[ 1+e^{-\alpha_ta-\beta_t} \right]^{-1} , &amp; a&gt;1 \\
    s_{t,a}     &amp;= \mu_se^{-\delta^\mu_t},                        &amp; a=1 \\

    \beta_{t}  &amp;= \bar \beta e^{\delta^\beta_t},                        
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where the parameters of the selectivity function follow a random walk process as in Dorn et al.&nbsp;(2000):</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    \delta_t^\mu  -  \delta_{t+1}^\mu     &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{\delta^\mu}^{2}) \\
    \\
    \alpha_t^\mu  -  \alpha_{t+1}^\mu     &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{\alpha^\mu}^{2}) \\
    \beta_t^\mu  -  \beta_{t+1}^\mu     &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{\beta^\mu}^{2})
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>The parameters to be estimated in this part of the model are thus for t=1982 through to 2024. The variance terms for these process error parameters were specified to be 0.04.</p>
<p>In this assessment, the random-walk deviation penalty was optionally shifted to the changes in log-selectivity. that is, for the BTS estimates, the process error was applied to the logistic parameters as above, but the lognormal penalty was applied to the resulting selectivities-at-age directly. The extent of this variability was evaluated in the context of the impact on age-specific survey catchability/availability and contrasted with an independent estimate of pollock availability to the bottom trawl survey. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    {ln(s_{t,a})}  -  {ln(s_{t+1,a})}  &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{sel}^{2}) \\
\end{align}\]</span> In 2008 the AT survey selectivity approach was modified. As an option, the age one pollock observed in this trawl can be treated as an index and are not considered part of the age composition (which then ranges from age 2-15). This was done to improve some interaction with the flexible selectivity smoother that is used for this gear and was compared. Additionally, the annual specification of input observation variance terms was allowed for the AT data.</p>
<p>A diagnostic approach to evaluate input variance specifications (via sample size under multinomial assumptions) was added in the 2018 assessment. This method uses residuals from mean ages together with the concept that the sample variance of mean age (from a given annual data set) varies inversely with input sample size. It can be shown that for a given set of input proportions at age (up to the maximum age <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) and sample size <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> for year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, an adjustment factor <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> for input sample size can be computed when compared with the assessment model predicted proportions at age (<span class="math inline">\(\hat p_{ta}\)</span>) and model predicted mean age (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bar{a_t}}\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\nu   &amp;= \text{var}\left( r^a_t \sqrt{\frac{N_t}{\kappa_t} }\right)^{-1} \\
r^a_t &amp;= \bar a_t - \hat{\bar{a_t}}                                      \\
\kappa_t &amp;= \left[ \sum_a^A {\bar a_t - \hat{\bar{a_t}}} \right]^{0.5}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r^a_t\)</span> is the residual of mean age and <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat{\bar{a_t}} &amp;= \sum_a^A{a \hat p_{ta}}\, \\
{\bar a_t}      &amp;= \sum_a^A{a p_{ta}}\,
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Based on previous analyses, we used the above relationship as a diagnostic for evaluating input sample sizes by comparing model predicted mean ages with observed mean ages and the implied 95% confidence bands. This method provided support for modifying the frequency of allowing selectivity changes.</p>

<section id="recruitment-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recruitment-1">Recruitment</h2>
<p>In these analyses, recruitment (<span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>) represents numbers of age-1 individuals modeled as a stochastic function of spawning stock biomass. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
        R_t = f\left(B_{t-1} \right)
\end{align}\]</span> with mature spawning biomass during year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> was defined as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  B_t = \sum_{a=1}^A{ w_{t,a}\phi_aN_{t,a}}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>and, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_a\)</span> is the proportion of mature females at age is as shown in the sub-section titled Natural mortality and maturity at age under “Parameters estimated independently” above.</p>
<p>A reparameterized form for the stock-recruitment relationship following <span class="citation" data-cites="francis1992use">Francis (<a href="#ref-francis1992use" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> was used. For the optional Beverton-Holt form (the Ricker form presented in Eq. 12 was adopted for this assessment) we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
R_t &amp;= \frac{B_{t-1}e^{\varepsilon_t} }{\alpha+\beta B_{t-1} }
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p>Values for the stock-recruitment function parameters and are calculated from the values of (the number of 0-year-olds in the absence of exploitation and recruitment variability) and the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship (<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>). The steepness is the fraction of R0 to be expected (in the absence of recruitment variability) when the mature biomass is reduced to 20% of its pristine level <span class="citation" data-cites="francis1992use">Francis (<a href="#ref-francis1992use" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> , so that:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\alpha &amp;= \tilde B_0 \frac{1-h}{4h} \\
\beta &amp;= \frac{5h-1}{4hR_0 }
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde B_0\)</span> is the total egg production (or proxy, e.g., female spawning biomass) in the absence of exploitation (and recruitment variability) expressed as a fraction of <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some interpretation and further explanation follows. For steepness equal 0.2, then recruits are a linear function of spawning biomass (implying no surplus production). For steepness equal to 1.0, then recruitment is constant for all levels of spawning stock size. A value of <span class="math inline">\(h = 0.9\)</span> implies that at 20% of the unfished spawning stock size will result in an expected value of 90% unfished recruitment level. Steepness of 0.7 is a commonly assumed default value for the Beverton-Holt form (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="kimura1989">Kimura (<a href="#ref-kimura1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span>). The prior distribution for steepness used a beta distribution as in Ianelli et al.&nbsp;(2016). The prior on steepness was specified to be a symmetric form of the Beta distribution with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \beta = 14.93\)</span> implying a prior mean of 0.5 and CV of 12% (implying that there is about a 14% chance that the steepness is greater than 0.6). This conservative prior is consistent with previous years’ application and serves to constrain the stock-recruitment curve from favoring steep slopes (uninformative priors result in <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> values near an <span class="math inline">\(F_{SPR}\)</span> of about <span class="math inline">\(F_{18\%}\)</span> a value considerably higher than the default proxy of <span class="math inline">\(F_{35\%}\)</span>). The residual pattern for the post-1977 recruits used in fitting the curve with a more diffuse prior resulted in all estimated recruits being below the curve for stock sizes less than <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> (except for the 1978 year class). We believe this to be driven primarily by the apparent negative-slope for recruits relative to stock sizes above <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> and as such, provides a potentially unrealistic estimate of productivity at low stock sizes. This prior was elicited from the rationale that residuals should be reasonably balanced throughout the range of spawning stock sizes. Whereas this is somewhat circular (i.e., using data for prior elicitation), the point here is that residual patterns (typically ignored in these types of models) were qualitatively considered.</p>
<p>In model 16.1 (from the 2019 assessment), a Beverton Holt stock recruitment form was implemented using the prior value of 0.67 for steepness and a CV of 0.17. This resulted in beta distribution parameters (for the prior) at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 6.339\)</span> and<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\beta = 4.293\)</span>.</p>
<p>The value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_R\)</span> was set at 1.0 to accommodate additional uncertainty in factors affecting recruitment variability.</p>
<p>To have the critical value for the stock-recruitment function (steepness, <em>h</em>) on the same scale for the Ricker model, we begin with the parameterization of <span class="citation" data-cites="kimura1989">Kimura (<a href="#ref-kimura1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> : <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
R_t &amp;= \frac{B_{t-1}e^{\alpha \left(1-B_{t-1} \frac{R_0}{\psi_0} \right)}}{\psi_0}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>It can be shown that the Ricker parameter a maps to steepness as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
h &amp;= \frac{e^\alpha}{e^\alpha+4}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>so that the prior used on <em>h</em> can be implemented in both the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment forms. Here the term <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span> represents the equilibrium unfished spawning biomass per-recruit.</p>
</section>
<section id="diagnostics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diagnostics">Diagnostics</h2>
<p>In 2006 a replay feature was added where the time series of recruitment estimates from a particular model is used to compute the subsequent abundance expectation had no fishing occurred. These recruitments are adjusted from the original estimates by the ratio of the expected recruitment given spawning biomass (with and without fishing) and the estimated stock-recruitment curve. I.e., the recruitment under no fishing is modified as: <span class="math display">\[R_t' = \hat{R}_t\frac{f(B_{t-1}')}{f(B_{t-1})}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the original recruitment estimate in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(B_{t-1}'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{t-1}\)</span> representing the stock-recruitment function given spawning biomass under no fishing and under the estimated fishing intensity, respectively.</p>
<p>The assessment model code allows retrospective analyses (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="parma1993">Parma (<a href="#ref-parma1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli1998">Ianelli and Fournier (<a href="#ref-ianelli1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>). This was designed to assist in specifying how spawning biomass patterns (and uncertainty) have changed due to new data. The retrospective approach simply uses the current model to evaluate how it may change over time with the addition of new data based on the evolution of data collected over the past several years.</p>
<p>To provide a diagnostic for diversity in the age structure of the spawning biomass, we computed the Shannon entropy in exponential form. Following <span class="citation" data-cites="jost2006">Jost (<a href="#ref-jost2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, and substituting the population’s mature age structure in place of species, this provides an estimate of the effective number of ages. This is computed for each year as a measure of different age groups contributing to the spawning population as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ H_i = \exp(-\sum p_a \cdot \log(p_a)) \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span> is the proportion of mature fish biomass-at-age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>

<section id="parameter-estimation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parameter-estimation">Parameter estimation</h2>
<p>The objective function was simply the sum of the negative log-likelihood function and logs of the prior distributions. To fit large numbers of parameters in nonlinear models it is useful to be able to estimate certain parameters in different stages. The ability to estimate stages is also important in using robust likelihood functions since it is often undesirable to use robust objective functions when models are far from a solution. Consequently, in the early stages of estimation we use the following log- likelihood function for the survey and fishery catch at age data (in numbers):</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, represent the number of age classes and years, respectively, n is the sample size, and represent the observed and predicted numbers at age in the catch. The elements bi,j represent ageing mis-classification proportions are based on independent agreement rates between otolith age readers. For the models presented this year, the option for including aging errors was re-evaluated.</p>
<p>Sample size values were revised and are shown in the main document. Strictly speaking, the amount of data collected for this fishery indicates higher values might be warranted. However, the standard multinomial sampling process is not robust to violations of assumptions (<span class="citation" data-cites="fournier1990multifan">Fournier et al. (<a href="#ref-fournier1990multifan" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span>). Consequently, as the model fit approached a solution, we invoke a robust likelihood function which fit proportions at age as:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\prod_{a=1}^A\prod_{t=1}^T \left[\left( \exp{\left(-\frac{\left(p_{ta}-\hat p_{ta}\right)^2}{2\left(\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\right)\tau_t^2} \right)
}+0.01 \right) \times  \frac{1}{ {\sqrt{2\pi \left ( \eta_{ta}+0.1/A \right) \tau_t}} } \right]
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>Taking the logarithm we obtain the log-likelihood function for the age composition data:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
nll(i) = -0.5\sum_{a=1}^A\sum_{t=1}^T{
{\ln{2\pi \left( \eta_{ta}+0.1/A \right)
-\sum_t^T A\ln\tau_t}} }
+\sum_{a=1}^A\sum_{t=1}^T{\ln\left\{
\exp{\left(-\frac{\left(p_{ta}-\hat p_{ta}\right)^2}{\left(2\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\right)\tau_t^2} \right)
+ 0.01 }
\right\}}
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\eta_{ta} &amp;=  p_{ta}(1-p_{ta})\\
\text{and} \\
\tau_t^2 &amp;=  1/n_t
\end{align}\]</span> which gives the variance for <span class="math inline">\(p_{ta}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
(\eta_{ta}+0.1/A)\tau_t^2
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Completing the estimation in this fashion reduces the model sensitivity to data that would otherwise be considered outliers.</p>
<p>Within the model, predicted survey abundance accounted for within-year mortality since surveys occur during the middle of the year. As in previous years, we assumed that removals by the survey were insignificant (i.e., the mortality of pollock caused by the survey was considered insignificant). Consequently, a set of analogous catchability and selectivity terms were estimated for fitting the survey observations as:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat N_{ta}^s &amp;= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where the superscript s indexes the type of survey (AT or BTS). For the option to use the survey predictions in biomass terms instead of just abundance, the above was modified to include observed survey biomass weights-at-age:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat N_{ta}^s &amp;= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}w_{ta}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>For the AVO index, the values for selectivity were assumed to be the same as for the AT survey and the mean weights at age over time was also assumed to be equal to the values estimated for the AT survey.</p>
<p>For these analyses we chose to keep survey catchabilities constant over time (though they are estimated separately for the AVO index and for the AT and bottom trawl surveys). The contribution to the negative log-likelihood function (ignoring constants) from the surveys is given by either the lognormal distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
nll(i) &amp;= \sum_t{\frac{\ln(u_t^s/\hat N_t^s)^2}{2\sigma_{s,t}^2}}
\end{align}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u_t^s\)</span> is the total (numerical abundance or optionally biomass) estimate with variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{s,t}\)</span> from survey <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or optionally, the normal distribution can be selected: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
nll(i) &amp;= \sum_t{\frac{(u_t^s - \hat N_t^s)^2}{2\sigma_{s,t}^2}}. \\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The AT survey and AVO index is modeled using a lognormal distribution whereas for the BTS survey, a normal distribution was applied.</p>
<p>For model configurations in which the BTS data are corrected for estimated efficiency, a multivariate lognormal distribution was used. For the negative- log likelihood component this was modeled as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
nll_i = 0.5\mathbf{X}\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{'}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where is a vector of observed minus model predicted values for this index and <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is the estimated covariance matrix provided from the method provided in <span class="citation" data-cites="kotwicki2014">Kotwicki et al. (<a href="#ref-kotwicki2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. For the VAST estimates, the supplied covariance matrix was used in the same way.</p>
<p>The contribution to the negative log-likelihood function for the observed total catch biomass (<span class="math inline">\(C_b^{obs}, \hat{C_b}\)</span>) by the fishery is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
nll_i = 0.5\sum_t\frac{\ln(C_b^{obs}/\hat C_b)^2}{2\sigma_{C_b,t}^2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{C_b,t}\)</span> is pre-specified (set to 0.05) reflecting the accuracy of the overall observed catch in biomass. Similarly, the contribution of prior distributions (in negative log-density) to the log-likelihood function include <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_\varepsilon \sum_t\varepsilon_t^2 +\lambda_\gamma \sum_{ta}\gamma^2 + \lambda_\delta \sum_t\delta_t^2\)</span> where the size of the ’s represent prior assumptions about the variances of these random variables. Most of these parameters are associated with year-to- year and age specific deviations in selectivity coefficients. For a presentation of this type of Bayesian approach to modeling errors-in- variables, the reader is referred to <span class="citation" data-cites="schnute1994">Schnute (<a href="#ref-schnute1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>. To facilitate estimating such a large number of parameters, automatic differentiation software extended from <span class="citation" data-cites="greiwank1991">Greiwank and Corliss (<a href="#ref-greiwank1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span> and developed into C++ class libraries was used. This software provided the derivative calculations needed for finding the posterior mode via a quasi-Newton function minimization routine (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="press1992">Press et al. (<a href="#ref-press1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>). The model implementation language (ADModel Builder) gave simple and rapid access to these routines and provided the ability estimate the variance-covariance matrix for all dependent and independent parameters of interest.</p>

<p>The approach we use to solve for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> and related quantities (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span>) within a general integrated model context was shown in <span class="citation" data-cites="ianelli2001">Ianelli and Williamson (<a href="#ref-ianelli2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>. In 2007 this was modified to include uncertainty in weight-at-age as an explicit part of the uncertainty for <span class="math inline">\(F_{MSY}\)</span> calculations.

<p>The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) experienced a prolonged period of above-average thermal conditions from 2014 through 2021. Since 2021, and continuing from August 2023–August 2024, thermal conditions in the EBS have been close to historical baselines of many metrics. There have been no sustained marine heatwaves over the southeastern or northern Bering Sea shelves since January 2021 (Callahan and Lemagie, 2024), and observed (Rohan and Barnett, 2024) and modeled (Kearney, 2024) bottom temperatures were mostly near-normal over the past year. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and bottom temperatures were near the long-term means in all regions by summer 2024. Notable deviations include (i) warm SSTs in the outer domain from fall 2023 through spring 2024 and (ii) unusually warm bottom temperatures in the northern outer domain since spring 2024 that may indicate an intrusion of shelf water (Callahan et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Age-0 fish experiencing warm temperatures during late summer followed by relatively cooler temperatures in spring of age-1 are thought to have below average survival. Based on this Temperature Change index, the 2023 year class of pollock experienced average late summer temperatures in 2023 during the age-0 stage and cooler spring temperatures in 2024 during the age-1 stage indicating average conditions for the overwintering survival from age-0 to age-1 (Yasumiishi, 2024).</p>
<p>Atmospheric conditions are one of the primary drivers that impact the oceanographic setting in the EBS. Both the North Pacific Index (NPI) and Aleutian Low Index (ALI) provide complementary views of the atmospheric pressure system in the North Pacific. During winter 2023-2024, the NPI was average (Siddon, 2024) and the strength and location of the Aleutian Low Pressure System were both near climatological averages (Overland and Wang, 2024). Thus, despite delayed formation of sea ice in fall 2023 (Thoman, 2024), cold winds from the Arctic helped advance sea ice to near-normal extent by mid-winter. Near-normal sea ice extent and thickness (Thoman, 2024b, 2024c) may have contributed to a cold pool (&lt;2°C water) of average spatial extent (Siddon, 2024), though the footprint of the coldest waters (&lt;0°C) in 2024 was 75% smaller than in 2023 (Rohan and Barnett, 2024b).</p>
<p>December 2023 had significant along-shelf winds (to the southeast) that could have driven offshore Ekman transport. Weaker, but more sustained winds that also favored offshore transport occurred from March to May 2024 (Hennon, 2024). Beginning in May and continuing through summer 2024, persistent storms resulted in a deeper mixed layer, which entrained deeper, cooler water, such that SSTs remained cooler through at least August 2024 (Stabeno, 2024). During the fall BASIS survey, age-0 pollock were found shallower in the water column, more comparable to a warm year (Spear and Andrews, 2024).</p>
<p>For projections into 2025, the National Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) predicts that SSTs over the EBS are expected to be near normal (anomalies within &lt;0.5°C of the 1982–2010 baseline) (Lemagie, 2024). With the expected transition to La Niña, cooler conditions in the EBS may follow. Relatively cool SSTs may contribute to earlier formation of sea ice than has been observed over the last several years (Thoman, 2024b).</p>
</section>
<section id="prey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prey">Prey</h2>
<p>Metrics of ocean acidification include Ωarag and pH. Ωarag is important for shell formation in pollock prey items like pteropods. Summer 2024 bottom water Ωarag conditions were similar to 2023; bottom waters remain near threshold levels of biological significance with the most corrosive bottom waters found in slope waters and over the northwest shelf (Pilcher et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Small copepods form the prey base for larval to early juvenile pollock during spring. Late juvenile pollock feed on a variety of planktonic crustaceans, including large calanoid copepods and euphausiids. The Rapid Zooplankton Assessment in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) in spring noted moderate abundance of small copepods, but low abundance of large copepods along the middle shelf (higher in the outer shelf) and near-zero abundance of euphausiids in the RZA, which is typical for the spring. In summer, small copepods remained abundant throughout the region. Large copepods remained in low abundance while euphausiids increased, especially towards the northern portion of the SEBS. Euphausiid density during the summer acoustic survey declined in 2024 to the second-lowest value in the time series (Levine and Ressler, 2024). In fall, both small and large copepods as well as euphausiids were in low abundance, but increased towards the north. In the northern Bering Sea (NBS) in fall, small copepods had moderate and consistent abundances throughout the sampling grid, large copepods were patchy with the highest values north and south of St. Lawrence Island, and euphausiids were very low (Kimmel et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Based on Food Habits Lab stomach content analysis, pollock consumption of copepods increased from 2023 to 2024, replacing euphausiids as the greatest percent by weight in the diets (K. Aydin, pers comm). This may be explained by the spatial distribution of the pollock stock in 2024, which was concentrated over the northwest outer domain (L. Barnett, pers comm), where large ‘oceanic’ copepods occur (euphausiids mainly occur over the middle domain). Additionally, rates of cannibalism have been low between 2021-2024; the lowest year for cannibalism on record was 2018 (K. Aydin, pers comm).</p>
<p>The estimated abundance of larval pollock sampled in spring increased from near the end of the last cold stanza (2012) through the warm stanza (2014, 2016, 2018) to a time-series maximum in 2024 (Rogers et al., 2024). The condition of those larval pollock was highest over the southeastern shelf and lowest to the northwest of the Pribilof Islands (Porter et al., 2024). By late summer, age-0 pollock CPUE estimates in the middle domain of the SEBS and NBS regions were lower than estimates from the recent warm period (2014–2021) but slightly higher than estimates from the cold period (2007–2013) (Andrews et al., 2024). In the inner domain, pollock were the most numerous non-salmonid species collected in the ADF&amp;G nearshore survey (Garcia et al., 2024). In the NBS, CPUE estimates have remained low compared to the SEBS (Andrews et al., 2024). Since 2022, with cooler SSTs, pollock weights and energy density have been low while % lipid has been average (Page et al., 2024).</p>
<p>In the SEBS, juvenile (100-250 mm) fish condition has shown a declining trend since 2021 while adult (&gt;250 mm) fish condition increased from 2023 to 2024, but remains below the long-term mean. In the NBS (data through 2023), juvenile fish condition has also declined since 2021, but adult fish condition increased since 2021 and was above average in 2023 (Prohaska et al., 2024). The availability of surface silicate, a proxy for phytoplankton growth, serves as an indicator of age-0 pollock condition. Low silicate availability and significant declines in pollock weight observed in 2022 may signal poorer recruitment to age-1 for the 2022 year class (Gann and Eisner, 2024).</p>
</section>
<section id="competitors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competitors">Competitors</h2>
<p>Jellyfish feed primarily on zooplankton and small fish, and therefore may compete for prey resources for both juvenile and adult life stages of pollock. The biomass of jellyfish over the southeastern shelf in 2024 remained low (Yasumiishi et al., 2024) to average (Buser and Rohan, 2024) while biomass remained high in the NBS (Yasumiishi et al., 2024). The 2024 forecast for Togiak herring was the fifth highest on record, but was 32% lower than the 2023 forecast (Dressel et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Western Alaska chum salmon showed trends of increasing adult returns, juvenile abundance, and above-average to average juvenile condition in recent years, which indicates potential signs of recovery for these populations. In contrast, western Alaska Chinook salmon do not appear to show signs of recovery in response to the recent cooler conditions observed since 2021. The abundance of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon peaked in 2021-2022, but cooler conditions since then have resulted in run sizes closer to the long-term average in 2023-2024 (DeFilippo, 2024). The condition (based on energy density anomalies) of juvenile pink, chum, coho, and Chinook salmon in the SEBS indicated lower energy stores and reduced capacity for overwinter survival. Juvenile salmon in the NBS had average to positive energy stores, which may contribute to higher overwinter survival (Fergusson et al., 2024).</p>
<p>The biomass of pelagic foragers measured during the standard bottom trawl survey (Jun-Aug; 1982–2024) increased 71% from 2023 to 2024 to just above their long-term mean. The trend is largely driven by pollock, which increased 78% from 2023. Pacific herring decreased 5% from 2023, but remain above their long-term mean (Siddon, 2024). The impacts of recent large year classes of sablefish to the EBS ecosystem (as prey, predators, and competitors) remain largely unknown at this time, but may compete with pollock for prey resources as juveniles.</p>
</section>
<section id="predators" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predators">Predators</h2>
<p>Pollock are cannibalistic and rates of cannibalism might be expected to increase as the biomass of older, larger fish increases (i.e., the aging of the large 2018 year class). However, rates of cannibalism have been low between 2021-2024 (K. Aydin, pers comm). In 2024, with an average cold pool extent over the shelf, predation pressure from cannibalism may have been mitigated by this thermal barrier as adult pollock tend to avoid the cold bottom waters.</p>
<p>Other potential predators of juvenile pollock include arrowtooth flounder, jellyfish and chum salmon. In the SEBS, the biomass of apex predators, which includes arrowtooth flounder, in 2024 remained just below the long term mean of that guild. Within that guild, however, arrowtooth flounder increased 26% from 2023 to 2024 (Siddon, 2024). Arrowtooth were distributed over the southern outer domain while pollock were distributed over the northern outer domain. As stated above, jellyfish biomass in the SEBS in 2024 remained low (Yasumiishi et al., 2024) to average (Buser and Rohan, 2024) while biomass was high in the NBS (Yasumiishi et al., 2024). Western Alaska chum salmon showed trends of increasing adult returns (DeFilippo, 2024).</p>

<li><p><strong>Prey:</strong> Trends of prey for pollock were mostly low in 2024, with prey conditions over the SEBS shelf being potentially more limiting while prey conditions over the NBS shelf appear limiting for age-0 and juvenile pollock, but sufficient for adult fish. The spatial distribution of adult pollock appears to have overlapped with large ‘oceanic’ copepods, while rates of cannibalism indicate reduced overlap with juvenile pollock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competitors</strong>: Trends in potential competitors were mixed over the shelf, with pollock representing the greatest increase in biomass and potential competitive pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predators</strong>: Trends in potential predators increased over the shelf, though spatial mismatch may mitigate realized predation pressure. Rates of cannibalism remained low in 2024.</p></li>

<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>These applications of <code>VAST</code> were configured to model NMFS/AFSC bottom trawl survey (BTS) data and for acoustic backscatter data (next section). For the BTS, the station-specific CPUEs (kg per hectare) for pollock were compiled from 1982-2023. Further details can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/james-%20thorson/VAST/#description">GitHub repo</a> mainpage, wiki, and glossary. The R help files, e.g., <code>?make_data</code> for explanation of data inputs, or <code>?make_settings</code> for explanation of settings.</p>
<p>The software versions of dependent programs used to generate VAST estimates were:</p>
<ul>
<li>R (4.3.0)</li>
<li>MKL libraries via Microsoft R Open (4.0.2)</li>
<li>INLA (21.11.22)</li>
<li>Matrix (1.4-0)</li>
<li>TMB (1.9.6)</li>
<li>TMBhelper (1.4.0)</li>
<li>VAST (3.10.1)</li>
<li>FishStatsUtils (2.12.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these model-based index time series, we used the same VAST model run settings.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatio-temporal-treatment-of-survey-data-on-pollock-density">Spatio-temporal treatment of survey data on pollock density</h2>
<p>For EBS pollock we used data on biomass per unit area from all grid cells and corner stations in the 83-112 bottom trawl survey of the EBS, 1982-2023, including exploratory northern extension samples in 2001, 2005, and 2006, as well as 83-112 samples available in the NBS in 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 2010, and 2017-2023 (except 2020). NBS samples collected prior to 2010 and in 2018 did not follow the 20 nautical mile sampling grid used in 2010, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 20232019, 2021–2023 surveys. Assimilating these data therefore required extrapolating into unsampled areas. As before, we included a a spatially varying covariate of the cold-pool extent (Thorson 2019, (O’Leary et al.&nbsp;2020). All environmental data used as covariates were computed within the R package coldpool (Rohan et al., 2022).</p>
<p>We used a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear predictors and a gamma distribution to model positive catch rates. We extrapolated population density to the entire EBS and NBS in each year, using extrapolation grids that are available within [FishStatsUtils] (https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils). These extrapolation grids were defined using 3705 m (2 nmi) × 3705 m (2 nmi) cells; this results in 36,690 extrapolation-grid cells for the eastern Bering Sea and 15,079 in the northern Bering Sea. We used bilinear interpolation to interpolate densities from 750 “knots” to these extrapolation grid cells; knots were approximately evenly distributed over space, in proportion to the dimensions of the extrapolation grid. We estimated geometric anisotropy (how spatial autocorrelation declines with differing rates over distance in some cardinal directions than others), and included a spatial and spatio-temporal term for both linear predictors. To facilitate interpolation of density between unsampled years, we specified that the spatio-temporal fields were structured over time as an AR(1) process (where the magnitude of autocorrelation was estimated as a fixed effect for each linear predictor). However, we did not include any temporal correlation for intercepts, which we treated as fixed effects for each linear predictor and year. Finally, we used epsilon bias-correction to correct for retransformation bias (Thorson and Kristensen 2016).</p>
<p>We checked model fits for evidence of non-convergence by confirming that (1) the derivative of the marginal likelihood with respect to each fixed effect was sufficiently small (less than ~0.001) and (2) that the Hessian matrix was positive definite. We then checked for evidence of model fit by computing Dunn-Smyth randomized quantile residuals (Dunn and Smyth 1996) and visualizing these using a quantile-quantile plot within the DHARMa R package. We also evaluated the distribution of these residuals over space in each year, and inspected them for evidence of residual spatio-temporal patterns.</p>

<section id="spatio-temporal-treatment-of-survey-age-composition-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatio-temporal-treatment-of-survey-age-composition-data">Spatio-temporal treatment of survey age composition data</h2>
<p>For model-based estimation of age compositions in the Bering Sea, we fitted observations of numerical abundance-at-age at each sampling location. This was made possible by applying a year-specific, region-specific (EBS and NBS) age-length key to records of numerical abundance and length-composition. We computed these estimates in VAST, assuming a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear predictors, and a gamma distribution to model positive catch rates. We did not include any density covariates in estimation of age composition for consistency with models used in the previous assessment, and due to computational limitations. We used the same extrapolation grid as implemented for abundance indices, but here we modeled spatial and spatiotemporal fields with a mesh with coarser spatial resolution than the index model, here using 50 “knots”. This reduction in the spatial resolution of the model, relative to that used abundance indices, was necessary due to the increased computational load of fitting multiple age categories and using epsilon bias-correction. We implemented the same diagnostics to check convergence and model fit as those used for abundance indices.</p>

## Diagnostic plots from BTS work
### Encounter-probability component
One can check to ensure that observed encounter frequencies for either low or high
probability samples are within the 95% predictive interval for predicted
encounter probability (Fig. \ref{fig:encounter}. 
Diagnostics for positive-catch-rate component were evaluated using a standard Q-Q plot. 
Qualitatively, the fits to pollock data are reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:eq1} and \ref{fig:qq2}).

### Pearson residuals
Spatially the residual pattern can be evaluated over time. Results for pollock data shows that consistent positive or negative 
residuals accross or within years is limited for the encounter probability component of the model and 
for the positive catch rate component (Figures \ref{fig:pearson1} and \ref{fig:pearson2}, respectively).

<p>Relative densities over time suggests that the biomass of pollock can reflect abundances in the NBS even in years where samples are unavailable (all years except 2010, 2017–2019 and 2021–2023; ().
